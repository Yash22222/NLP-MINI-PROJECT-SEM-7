# Emirates Passenger Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves scraping passenger reviews for Emirates from the AirlineQuality website and performing sentiment analysis to classify the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis provides insights into customer experiences and overall sentiment trends.

## Installation Instructions
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas nltk vaderSentiment matplotlib wordcloud
```

## Usage Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yash22222/NLP-MINI-PROJECT-SEM-7.git
   cd NLP-MINI-PROJECT-SEM-7
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the main script in your Python environment:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Output Files:**
   The results will be saved in:
   - `data.csv`: Contains the raw reviews.
   - `Emirates_Data.csv`: Contains the reviews along with sentiment analysis results.

## Code Explanation
### 1. Web Scraping
The script scrapes reviews from the AirlineQuality website using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Cleans the text data by removing special characters and unnecessary information from the reviews.

### 3. Tokenization and POS Tagging
Utilizes NLTK for tokenizing the cleaned text and tagging parts of speech.

### 4. Lemmatization
Converts words to their base forms using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer.

### 5. Sentiment Analysis
Applies VADER to compute sentiment scores for each review.

### 6. Data Visualization
Visualizes the sentiment distribution using Matplotlib and generates word clouds for frequently used terms in reviews.

## Results and Analysis
The sentiment analysis categorizes the reviews into:
- **Negative Reviews**
- **Neutral Reviews**
- **Positive Reviews**

## Future Work
- Expand the scraping to include more airlines or review sites.
- Improve sentiment analysis accuracy using advanced NLP models.
- Analyze sentiment trends over time.
