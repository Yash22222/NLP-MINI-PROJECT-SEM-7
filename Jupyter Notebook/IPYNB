This project focuses on scraping and analyzing passenger reviews for Air India from the AirlineQuality website. By employing web scraping techniques, 
we gather a significant dataset of customer feedback. We then perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, specifically 
leveraging the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool to classify the reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. 
The findings are visualized through various charts and word clouds, providing insights into customer experiences and sentiment trends regarding Air 
India's services. This analysis aims to inform stakeholders about public perception and areas for improvement.
