1,"   I've done 4 very long distance flights with Emirates and I have to say I'm the most disappointed with the cabin staff service. Many of them appeared really moody or even mean on all 4 flights. They always seemed annoyed and unimpressed when requesting their service for anything. I assume they're just taught to be lovely to business and first class customers and economy doesn't matter? It's just so odd. Are they extremely stressed or something? Even the cheapest airline staff has been much nicer to me every single time. I really wouldn't call myself a difficult customer - one time I asked if the staff could turn down the fan a few rows down mine because I couldn't reach and the air was making me freezing cold to which the cabin crew replied ""Okay but I can't reach it so I have to ask the people in that row, next time just ask them yourself"". What's that about? Then they also forgot to take my partners food tray and when they were coming around I told them about it and was met with ""Oh... okay"". Not a sorry or anything at all. I thought they would be trained to provide an overall better experience and interaction. Also I haven't pressed the button for staff service many times, but out of the times I have, they responded in only about 30% of the cases. Overall I'm absolutely disappointed with the cabin crew. Otherwise, the food was quite nice, the Internet was unreachable most of the time, plane relatively clean.","   I've done 4 very long distance flights with Emirates and I have to say I'm the most disappointed with the cabin staff service.

4,"   Mistreat unaccompanied minor passengers. Travellers can only obtain VISAS through only one visa provider. We followed correct process for visa application and at the airport confirmed with departures that visa was valid. The unaccompanied child was permitted to board the Emirates flight, I still paid $100 additional for unaccompanied minor service. The entire time I checked with all stakeholders could this child travel unaccompanied to Dubai on her own. Every single time I was told yes. Emirates sold me the ticket, Emirates sold me the unaccompanied minor package but now are not accepting responsibility! Upon arrival in Dubai the minor was aggressively treated by immigration, detained for 24 hours and deported back home. The child was not permitted to cross the border to visit her grandmother residing in Dubai. Now the airline claims that the grandmother could have applied for a different visa at the Dubai airport. So they won't allow the child to leave with the grandmother but they will allow the grandmother to apply for another visa? Flawed policy. That is all these greedy airlines care about. The child was detained and while her physical needs were taken care of, she has been left psychologically traumatized.

12,"   Emirates did not live up to its reputation. On two of the four legs they ran out of food options. The meals were only served 2-3 hours into the flight. The worst happened on the last leg between DXB and JHB. We were seated between 4 drunk passengers (2 unrelated to the other 2) who’s behavior was shocking and filthy to say the least. The staff didn’t really handle the situation well and it seemed like they rather chose not to have any confrontation. Quite frankly, we were surprised those passengers were even allowed to board since they were already clearly drunk at the airport. In fact, 2 of them seemed to be somewhat drugged as well. The other two drunk passengers made the flight really uncomfortable for those around them, even indecently exposing themselves. We were just grateful that they did not become aggressive, posing a risk to smooth flight operations. The cabin supervisor’s judgement was poor and the cabin crew did nothing to rectify the situation, even after being alerted to the problem. In fact, they served 2 of them more alcohol which was absolutely the wrong thing to do. We have to say that we have never experienced such poor service and unprofessionalism before.

16,"  Ground Staff and Service Failures on Flight EK 354. My carefully planned return trip from UK, with EMIRATES turned into a nightmare due to issues caused by their Dubai ground staff.  Upon checking in Manchester, I was issued a boarding pass for the MAN-DXB and DXB-SIN legs of my journey, with seats allocated according to my pre booking. However, upon reaching Dubai and during check-in, the counter staff took my boarding pass and issued a new one. Initially, I presumed new boarding pass was due to a soiled document and did not notice the seat change as there is no change in flight. To my disappointment, the new seat I was assigned turned out to be directly in front of the toilet onboard. I also sought assistance from cabin crew and online chat services before take-off, but unfortunately, no one helped me. I had specifically opted for an Economy Flex Plus ticket, solely to secure a seat reservation that would allow for a more comfortable journey. The proximity to the restroom doors, with their associated noise, significantly hindered my ability to rest or enjoy the flight services as intended. Furthermore, crew members accessing the overhead luggage bins above my seat at regular intervals further disrupted any chance of relaxation. Additionally, during the meal service, crew members did not lock the lavatory door, causing passengers to enter and exit while I was eating. This forced me to stop my meal. At the end of the journey, the crew sarcastically asked me about my flight experience, despite being well aware of the difficulties I had faced. Emirates' service in 2024 should be considered among the worst. Until today I have not received any reply on my compliant placed with Emirates and their customer service reminded me that it requires 60 days to send a reply. I must tell that compare to past, Emirates service quality are highly deteriorated and no one care of it there.","  Ground Staff and Service Failures on Flight EK 354.

18,   I had a flight in April from Mumbai to Dubai to London. Due to the rains / flood in Dubai flights were getting canceled but Emirates never bothered to inform the passengers. I had to spend 6k (back and forth) on Uber coming from Pune to Mumbai to catch the flight. After I got to the gate they told me the flight was canceled. I was so furious. I asked them why I never got any text or email update and they blamed it on the passengers. So I asked her to verify my phone number. When I got to the airport I checked on the app about the flight details and till that time it showed on time. They never even bothered to change that. Now that I am asking for my refund they are not taking responsibility and returning my money. ,   I had a flight in April from Mumbai to Dubai to London.

21,"  I have always been flying in Emirates because of their good services but this time we had a very bad experience! The cabin crews were terrible to say the least especially from Dhaka to Dubai. We asked for a Bassinet for the baby a few times but didn't get one. The baby fell asleep and I was holding for about half an hour watering a bassinet still did not get one then I had to speak to one of the cabin crews with a firm tone to get one! They didn't even offer lunch to one of my daughters. When asked, the lady said oh do you want lunch? What do you mean? She is 11 years old and needs food to eat on board, doesn't she? They also didn't give us any baby food either. My boy was hungry and crying. The lady next to me with infants had to share one of her babies food with my boy. When I fed that food to my son, one cabin crew came with some baby food which we didn't ask for saying we ran out of what you asked for. Just terrible! We also noticed in general the cabin crews were unprofessional, careless and ignoring the passengers' requests. It was a terrible experience this time.

22,"   I am writing this review to express my profound disappointment and frustration with the service provided by various departments, particularly customer support, following the cancellation of my flight from Vienna to Male last April due to the recent floods in Dubai. While I understand the circumstances surrounding the flight cancellation, the issue lies with the abysmal customer support I have encountered since then. Upon requesting a certificate for insurance purposes, I was informed that I would need to wait 30 days for processing, which I accepted as part of the procedures. However, upon receiving the certificate after the specified period, it was found to be incorrect for both myself and my travel companion. Subsequent attempts to rectify this error have been met with further delays and inefficiencies. Despite being advised to fill out another form for follow-up, it has now been two months since my initial request, and I am still awaiting the correct certificates. The lack of assistance and communication from customer support has been appalling, with promises to escalate the issue to the relevant department unfulfilled and no resolution in sight. As a loyal customer of Emirates, I am deeply dismayed by the subpar level of customer support and service provided in this instance. The unresolved issue with the certificates has also led to a delay in processing my insurance claim, further exacerbating the situation. It is truly disheartening to experience such incompetence and negligence. The disparity between the exceptional flight services and the inadequate customer support is not only disappointing but also unacceptable.","   I am writing this review to express my profound disappointment and frustration with the service provided by various departments, particularly customer support, following the cancellation of my flight from Vienna to Male last April due to the recent floods in Dubai.

23," Having flown almost exclusely in business class for work travel paid for by my employer, the thought of 19+ hours in economy class from Delhi to Washington via Dubai filled me with dread. I was pleasantly surprised, however, by EK's economy product. While it is still economy and you can never 'go flat', I found Emirates' economy to be way better than United or Air Canada economy and, overall, offers solid hard and soft products. The seat is a decent size and has good legroom, again, compared to North American carriers. Catering was good with two full meals and a pizza or sandwich snack in between. Meal portions were good with plenty of variety. I was impressed by the 'engineering' of the economy meal tray with every conceivable space used to offer something. Every time I rang the call button, it was answered pleasantly. Washrooms were kept quite clean throughout both sectors. The ICE entertainment system offers tons of options.

26,"  The economy cabin in this airline is the worst in the world. Very rude flight attendants and crew.

30," I fly a lot, but Emirates were my worst experiences ever. Most importantly, 2 out of 2 times I flew with them, I was delayed for multiple hours. The first time it was just sitting on the plane with no AC for 2 hours, and the second was 3+ hours, due to some trivial problem with their cabin lights. That 2nd time I had a connecting flight to catch, and while on board they assured me it would be fine, and while I did make it to the gate while they were still boarding, they refused to board me due to having apparently unilaterally decided to rebook me to a flight 11 hours later, assuming I wouldn't make it. Turns out there were earlier flights, but they wouldn't book me to them due to not codesharing with those airlines. Not only was no compensation offered for this day-long delay, but when I finally booked a separate flight on my own, they wouldn't even refund me, and had me request it on my own online. Overall they just showed 0 willingness to help throughout the entire process, despite it being 100% their fault, for a delay caused by them and between flights both of which they operated. They made it as painful as it possibly could be, every step of the way. Oh, and the flights themselves were also bad - old-looking airplanes, terrible food, and relatively limited entertainment. Emirates might have earned a positive reputation due to their First Class experience, but for Economy flights, it's probably the worst airline I've ever flown."," I fly a lot, but Emirates were my worst experiences ever.

33,"   On 3/9/2024, I transferred more than 300,000 points from Chase Ultimate Reward to Emirates Skywards account for First Class miles redemption for a flight from Seattle to Thailand. Shortly after that, Skywards locked my account, indicating it's due to ""a routine review."" However, after more than a few weeks, my account was still under ""a routine review."" That's when I started making a call to their customer service, but all they can do is sending an email to the internal team and told me to do the same, which I did ... but no response whatsoever from the internal team. Subsequent calls to the customer services and after hours of explaining, arguing, pleading yield the same outcome (or lack thereof.) The customer service agents were not willing to escalate the issue for us even though they knew that this issue has been going on way longer than their normal timeline. they did not try to help you in any way regardless of how bad the situation is. There was one one time after we pushed so hard to get to talk to their supervisor but even him would not try to help you anyway.

53,"   On both the outward and return flights, I or my travel partner sat on a broken seat. Yes, we had booked economically, but then you can expect a fully functioning chair, right? Our flight to Bali took more than twenty hours in total. The quality of the chairs was nothing to write home about. We arrived at all destinations broken. I bought a new suitcase in Bali. This one also arrived “broken” at home in Amsterdam. One flight with Emirates was apparently too much for this beautiful suitcase. After some correspondence back and forth with Emirates, the conclusion was that they could not do anything for me and would not take responsibility. My conclusion is therefore to take a look at other companies where service may still be expected. In any case, I won't be booking Emirates again anytime soon. My next flight to Bali is with our KLM. Zowel op de heen- als op de terugvlucht zat ik of mijn reispartner op een kapotte stoel. Ja, we hadden economisch geboekt, maar dan mag je toch wel een volledig functionerende stoel verwachten?

Op Bali had ik een nieuwe koffer gekocht. Deze kwam ook “gebroken aan” thuis in Amsterdam. Één vlucht met Emirates was blijkbaar te veel voor deze mooie koffer.

58,"  The service provided is absolutely unacceptable and beyond what I’ve ever experienced. The flight from Lisbon to Dubai was delayed by 3 hrs. Connecting flight to Phuket was missed due to that which of course can happen but there was zero handling of the situation in Dubai - it took 4,5 hours at the airport standing in lines to get a new boarding pass and a hotel voucher. Before that no information at all. After all this they take you to a hotel which is 30 minutes away from the airport without telling before which hotel and where it is - arriving at the hotel another long waiting session and then no one can say when the shuttle bus is going back to the airport - we don’t have that information, end of conversation! Zero information. Zero service. I booked seats on the flight in advance to be able to rest and in the email about the new flight it said the booked seat will remain for the new flight but that is not the case at all. So now instead of my paid window seat I’m sitting straight in the middle. All the service chat tells you is to file a complaint. Also I paid for a hotel in Phuket that I don’t get to use. This was by far the worst I’ve ever experienced by any airline. It’s such a joke, the way they treat people, their customers. Especially at the airport- no one cared at all for all of the travelers facing this situation. Everyone was treated with pure ignorance. Biggest mistreatment and miss organization ever!

61,"  Our BKK-DXB flight was delayed for 18 hours and as a result we missed our DXB WAW connecting flight. We were offered a long flight with one more transfer DXX-LJU - WAW no longer on Emirates and FlyDubai on budget airlines where the standard was far below expectations. Unfortunately, because of Emirates we also missed the next transfer and instead of 16 hours our journey lasted over 60 hours. The worst thing is that the Emirates hotline showed no interest in our problems. We personally had to nervously look for connections to WAW. I filed a complaint, but Emirates did not respond. They awarded bonus miles instead, but I never want to use Emirates again. It is certainly not a premium airline which shows absolutely no interest to problems of their passengers and to their misconduct. I feel robbed. If I had been focused on low price, not taking service / comfort / time of journey, I would have chosen some different airline paying less. Yet, I paid much, much more and I got absolutely long journey, poor service, absolute disrespect from Emirates hotline, and no refund. They gave me worthless bonus miles.

64," Every step of the travel, I found harassment, terrible customer support, and absolutely no help. I am treated like an economy class customer in all aspects. Check-in: 1. Rude arrogant check in staff at SFO: refused to accommodate a box that exceeded 59 inches though far underweight than half of 70 kgs allowed. Arrogant staff refused to ever entertain my request as the app clearly mentioned that I could take up to 115 inches, without mentioning additional cost over 59 inches. 2. Reached DXB. At the gate, someone came over with my name and he was not aware of hotel option despite mentioning that I received it in my last trip. When I finally approach Terminal 3 First class lounge, they gave me hotel voucher after a lot of time. Even lounge front desk didn't have that information. 3. The lounge front desk refused to help me get to chauffeur service, didn't tell me 'EXACT' steps on how to reach Arrivals. It was the most terrible experience for someone going there for the first time. The desk that manages Chauffer service was incompetent and provided inaccurate gate info where I could get car to hotel. All this exercise took 1.5 hours, eating up on my plans to go out to the city. 4. When I checked back in the following day, 27th Feb, the second bag was not loaded despite being first class, despite paying for it and despite 19 hours of transit. When I landed and waited for it at carousel, app displayed delayed bag with PIR info. 5. Apparently the customer service agents pretended that they cannot get my contact details to update the baggage claim report/PIR and kept blaming me for it. They knew the flight I was in, the bag number and access to my profile, but kept saying that they can't update me because I didn't provide phone number and email address, both were there in my Emirates profile long before my travel date. 6. No communication on missed bag despite repeated contacts with customer support. Emirates has provided the worst travel experience all around in spite of paying for first class and for additional baggage. This is my last trip with Emirates and request everyone to not waste their money/miles on Emirates. You will always hit a wall in getting somethin we think is customer service. There will be no help, no customer support, no sensitivity or understanding. All I experienced is arrogant highhandedness, no respect for customers."," Every step of the travel, I found harassment, terrible customer support, and absolutely no help.

They have the worse customer service if you was to encounter a problem or issue.","[('First', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('lost', 'v'), ('baggage', 'n'), ('arrival', 'n'), ('help', 'n'), ('next', 'a'), ('nothing', 'n'), ('.', None), ('1', None), ('2', None), ('baggage', 'n'), ('missing', 'v'), ('arrived', 'v'), ('Singapore', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('.', None), ('waiting', 'v'), ('belt', 'n'), ('asking', 'v'), ('member', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('found', 'v'), ('baggage', 'n'), ('tag', 'n'), ('scanned', 'v'), ('transfer', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('.', None), ('therefore', None), ('baggage', 'n'), ('somewhere', 'r'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('knowing', 'v'), ('identified', 'v'), ('lost', 'v'), ('yet', 'r'), ('.', None), ('airport', 'n'), ('team', 'n'), ('gave', 'v'), ('Reference', 'n'), ('told', 'v'), ('keep', 'v'), ('updated', 'a'), ('.', None), ('asked', 'v'), ('number', 'n'), ('call', 'v'), ('airport', 'n'), ('office', 'n'), ('provided', 'v'), ('number', 'n'), ('form', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Next', 'a'), ('day', 'n'), ('called', 'v'), ('number', 'n'), ('switch', 'n'), ('board', 'n'), ('multiple', 'a'), ('attempts', 'n'), ('speaking', 'v'), ('agent', 'n'), ('transfer', 'v'), ('airport', 'n'), ('counter', 'n'), ('know', 'v'), ('anything', 'n'), ('tell', 'v'), ('someone', 'n'), ('touch', 'a'), ('true', 'a'), ('.', None), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('helpline', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('website', 'n'), ('useless', 'a'), ('get', 'v'), ('speak', 'v'), ('real', 'a'), ('person', 'n'), ('help', 'n'), ('.', None), ('idea', 'n'), ('next', 'a'), ('couple', 'n'), ('days', 'n'), ('luggage', 'n'), ('lost', 'v'), ('?', None), ('communication', 'n'), ('ever', 'r'), ('throughout', None), (',', None), ('multiple', 'a'), ('emails/', 'n'), ('calls/', 'n'), ('feedback', 'n'), ('emirates', 'n'), ('response', 'n'), ('.', None), ('customer', 'n'), ('affair', 'n'), ('team', 'n'), ('takes', 'v'), ('9', None), ('months', 'n'), ('even', 'r'), ('reply', 'v'), ('.', None), ('another', None), ('outstanding', 'a'), ('experience', 'n'), ('April', 'n'), ('2023', None), ('Tokyo', 'n'), ('Manchester', 'n'), ('luggage', 'n'), ('smashed', 'v'), ('offered', 'v'), ('compensation', 'n'), ('asked', 'v'), ('go', 'v'), ('repair', 'n'), ('centre', 'n'), ('quote', 'n'), ('8', None), ('months', 'n'), ('incident', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Took', 'v'), ('8', None), ('months', 'n'), ('acknowledge', 'v'), ('claim', 'n'), ('probably', 'r'), ('made', 'v'), ('20', None), ('phone', 'n'), ('calls', 'n'), ('change', 'v'), ('multiple', 'a'), ('email', 'n'), ('.', None), ('worse', 'a'), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('encounter', 'v'), ('problem', 'n'), ('issue', 'n'), ('.', None)]","  First time lose baggage arrival help next nothing . 1 2 baggage miss arrive Singapore airport . wait belt ask member staff airport find baggage tag scan transfer Dubai . therefore baggage somewhere Dubai know identify lose yet . airport team give Reference tell keep updated . ask number call airport office provide number form .

71," This was my first trip on Emirates. I paid $1,400 for my economy ticket. I also paid to select my seats. I specifically chose an aisle seat because I have neuropathy and needed to ensure I could stand up regularly to avoid blood clots & not disturb others. Immediately, I noticed the man sitting next to me, sharing an armrest with me, that he dominated, was sniffing and digging hard up his nose every couple of minutes nonstop. He would then touch everything around us, including the armrest. Each time he dug up his nose, he would grab the armrest that we shared in common. He also put his hand on my side and touched the screen, picked up something that fell and handed it to me. He was openly digging up his nose and touching everything while sniffing, indicating sickness. I was wearing a mask. He was not. I was entirely grossed out and very concerned for my health and safety. It was not a one time act, but a continuing behavior, every few minutes. I told attendants to observe his conduct too. The flight was over 12 hours long and I could not stomach this nasty behavior the long flight and risk my fragile health and safety sitting next to this man, imagine trying to eat next to him. I spoke to the flight attendants a minimum of three different times. Their eventual solution was to move me from my seat up front to the very back of the airplane, far from my colleagues. I was traveling with three companions, two sitting in front of me and one in first class. Our paid seats were the first seats behind economy preferred class. There were dozens of available seats in that section that were close to my companions and only a few feet away from the section I was sitting in that I paid for. Rather than make my health a priority and move me to a safer section, they attempted to move me to the very back of the plane. They said they couldn't say anything to the man. I didn't want to leave my companions. It was so frequent that I took evidence the entire flight to prove it. The only time he used a napkin was when they served food, and he used the one from his tray to clean his nose. That is the napkin he dropped on me, reaching over me to the stewardess. It was their jobs to help keep me safe. I was content in the seat I purchased near the front, on the aisle. I wasn't seeking to be upgraded. But if those were the only seats available, in close proximity to the seat I purchased, and still near my companions; rather than make me sit over 12 hours stressed out trying to avoid bodily fluids; put at a health & safety risk sitting next to a man openly wiping his bodily fluids on my seat, the armrest & me, they should have moved me to those seats, not the back of the plane.

72," Check in desk at Montreal airport going to Philippines: We were traveling as a family with my senior mom, my wife and my infant that was 11months old. We did our check in online and made sure we chose a bulkhead seat to be able to use the basinet. To our surprise when we got to the plane they have changed our seats without letting us know. Very inconvenient and stressful since we where counting on those seats. The explanation they gave to us was that when there is a change of the type of plane they can not guarantee the seats we chose. I believe thats not a good reason to give and is a sorry excuse. If there is a change of any sort they have the responsibility to let us know I would have been glad to pay for a better seat. Morever, our return flight was even worst. At the checkein gate right before boarding,from Dubai to Montreal, they told us that we needed to check-in our carryon bags since there was no space on the overhead storage due to full capacity. We told them that we can not do so since we have an infant with us and that the carry on and baby diaper bags where a must, plus her toys,formula and food etc. They still refuse and told us we needed to check in our carry on. We were within what we were allowed to bring to the plane and still we needed to check in our things. I find this ridiculous. They do not meet the product that they are offering or selling and they have no sence of transparency at this point and a sense of understanding the situation we were in. The staff also was rude and just ignored my concerns. Not a family friendly airline thats for sure. Food and entertainment: horrible and tastless and the 2 planes going back from philippines to Dubai and transit then to Montreal my entertainement screen were broken. Staff in the plane I can clearly see that they do their best but are sometime not found when you need them, especially in a long haul flight when everyone is sleeping.

76,"   My wife and I along with 2 friends took the Emirates flight from Newark, NJ to Athens in September 2023. We had never flown on Emirates but decided to give them a try over American or Delta. The numerous tv commercials with actress Penelope Cruz has subliminally triggered something that inspired me to convince my wife and friends that we should give them a try. At the time of our ""economy"" booking we decided to pay an additional $410 per couple for seat upgrades. We had opted to pay more for the 2 seats together rather than the sitting in a row of three or fours seat in the center of the plane. As soon as we boarded the plane and took our seats I knew the outbound flight was going to be torture. The 2 seats that we paid $205 extra for were so small with walled sides and hand rests that didn't move would have been great if we were all contortionists but unfortunately we were not. We made it to Athens 10 hours later and after a couple of good nights sleep we put this horrible memory behind us so as not to ruin our 2 week long awaited vacation. About a week into the trip we did some research on the web and decided to downgrade our return seats from the same mini seats that we flew out on and instead opted for the standard seats that were in the middle section of the plane that included 4 seats. This was a great move as our return flight was much more comfortable. When I contacted Emirates upon our arrival and asked to get back the $205 paid for the return downgraded seats, their reply was that they do not issue refunds for seat downgrades. That said, the 4 of us will never travel on Emirates again. As a postscript I want to mention that none of the 4 our us, all retired and in our late 60's are heavy or have large behinds, to the contrary, we are all smaller individuals who have never had any comparable torturous seats while flying anywhere in the world. Unless you are Penolope Cruz and get complimentary ""first class"" seating or opt to pay the additional thousands of dollars, stay away from Emirates.

83,"  I (via a travel agent) booked a round-trip business class flight with Emirates that ended in Queenstown, NZ. Upon arriving for a layover in Melbourne at 23:30 after a 13-hour business class flight from Dubai, I was looking forward to a shower. However, I was denied entry to the Emirates lounge, without any real explanation as to why. The gentleman at the counter was more interested in making me go away than helping me understand the situation, so, confused, I called Emirates ""customer service."" They bluntly informed me that if I wanted to use the lounge so badly, my travel agent should have booked the flight from Melbourne to Queenstown on Qantas. As it turns out, the leg from Melbourne to Queenstown that I had was on Emirates partner Jetstar. As Jetstar does not have a business class cabin, this one leg (out of 5 total legs) was economy. I should note that the entire itinerary was booked through Emirates, and part of my confusion stemmed from the fact that they all had Emirates flight numbers. But what I had here was an Emirates flight operated by Jetstar (and the same flight also had a Qantas flight number - one flight, three partners, three numbers). I should have gotten the Emirates flight operated by Qantas that was departing an hour later, as Qantas has a business class cabin, and it would have been the same cost anyway. If it's the same cost anyway, why not let me come in and take a shower? It's 1am and there is no one else here. Additionally, they do not care if the arriving flight is business, or if 4/5 legs are business, you are not special. No kindness, no attempts at understanding or helpfulness or smoothing over the situation. Just rudeness and criticism.

86," I was compelled to write a review for an airline because of the exceptional service I got from the whole team of the cabin crew. It was more of a great experience rather than a journey. Right from the entrance to the aircraft I was treated like a beloved family member who came to see the family after years by every staff member. Every single request was taken seriously and was addressed to the best of the availability. I felt that I was the only special passenger for them, they were super nice and highly empathetic in their body language. The air hostess assigned to my area was asking me every single time she passed by me with a great smile if all was good. When you enter the lounge you are greeted with super smiles, if you ask them something they come close to you holding shoulders to show attachment. They were all super devoted to their work, full of energy and trying to help everyone as much they can. I am a frequent flyer of Emirates, though the maintenance inside aircraft has compromised that fresh and modern look but their crew members compensated that by miles. My special thanks and 7 star to every single staff member in the busines class cabin."," I was compelled to write a review for an airline because of the exceptional service I got from the whole team of the cabin crew.

Also during 50 mins of turbulence they only allow business class passengers use the toilet and the whole economic class passengers were not allowed.

96,"   First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying. Emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as 2nd class passengers without any rights. My wife and I flew to Spain and Portugal from Singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group. On our return flights first from Madrid to Dubai on EK142 on 9 Oct 2023 and from Dubai to Singapore on EK 354 on 10 Oct 2023, my wife and I were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft. When I enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the 2 flights as I am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder (which has been affecting me for the past 5 years), the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat 6 rows ahead. She said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from Dubai to Singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in Dubai for help. When we reached Dubai, the tour manager, my wife and I, another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to B18 boarding gate. The guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the 2 counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter. He told us to use the self-help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats. The computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter. The guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and I in the queue. However, our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter. There was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff. Eventually one of the staff involved in the 'conversation' told the guard to admit all of us and 'royally allowed' us to talk to him behind the counter. He told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as 'non-paying' passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated. Our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial/partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows 81 to 83 and he could not help in any way. My question to the airline is this: if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial/partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together. What happens if there are families with young children? Furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats (say rows 61 to 63 or 81 to 83 and not all window seats or not all middle seats) in advance why can't it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers' preference and needs? Even in times of profit squeeze when corporations try to extract every cent from its passengers, how much money can you make to justify discriminating and alienating your passengers just because the 25 of them are travelling as part of a package tour?","   First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying.

97,"   I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my recent experience on Emirates Flight EK2185, scheduled for August 6th, 2023, from Dubai to Catania. The flight was canceled less than 24 hours in advance, which severely impacted my long-haul trip. This trip was booked through the Emirates website and was disrupted just hours before its departure due to the cited 'unforeseen circumstances,' namely a fire at Catania Airport, which had occurred three weeks prior. Being an aware passenger, I was cognizant of the previous flight cancellations to Catania and the airport's incapacity to handle extra-Schengen flights. Consequently, I had been diligently monitoring the situation, investing significant time and financial resources from a remote location in South Africa to stay updated and explore alternative travel options in case of an eventual cancellation. My distressing experience began when I found myself caught in a bureaucratic game of ping-pong between Emirates and Flydubai, the airline operating the flight. Both carriers appeared to evade responsibility and failed to offer me any practical alternative plans. The cancellation notification reached me while I was en route to the airport, necessitating an unscheduled stop in an area with phone reception to contact the Emirates call center, as per Flydubai's app recommendation. To my dismay, I spent over 30 minutes on the phone only to discover that Emirates was not presenting any viable options for reaching my final destination. Furthermore, their communication regarding alternative flights from Dubai to Italy was initially unclear—mentioning Rome or Milan—and later, limited to Naples, with no apparent connection to Catania. It was only after a protracted discussion that the call-center operator finally intervened, reconfiguring my entire reservation to a flight bound for Milan, just an hour before my scheduled check-in at Skukuza. This change, which was seemingly necessitated by Emirates' arcane policies, left me in Dubai without compensation for the additional time spent there. I was accommodated in a shared room with no meals, a circumstance that I managed to secure solely because my partner already had a reservation for a Dubai Connect service. Following the call-center operator's instructions, I had to personally book a new flight from Milan to Catania, incurring additional expenses. The overwhelming stress and uncertainty surrounding this ordeal marred a significant portion of my holiday experience. I requested that Emirates recognized the hardships I endured during this journey, including the extra costs incurred due to the days of delay and the missed medical appointment. However, they just said they could do nothing.","   I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my recent experience on Emirates Flight EK2185, scheduled for August 6th, 2023, from Dubai to Catania.

100," I had a poor experience on this flight. I have been using Emirates' services for over 20 years, being a Blue member and, then, a Silver member, up until the time of covid. I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates’ service. Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered vegetarian food, and received a snack soon after take-off, along with a sealed cup of water. Subsequently, meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks, but I was offered nothing, and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink. At the next opportunity, when a steward passed by, I requested a drink, but was advised to wait until lunch was served (a very poor response, I felt). I reiterated: I would like a drink as soon as possible (as I was thirsty). The person in seat 30G was asleep and I could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance. A drink was subsequently provided (but over 15 minutes later). However, the table in 30F is/was not secure and the drink slid off, spilled over me and the person in 30G next to me. The people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess. Later on, lunch did arrive, but it was 2 hours after I had first requested a drink (so, my request for a drink had been vindicated). When food trays were later collected, mine was overlooked, the steward passed me by, and my food tray was left for over half an hour. When a steward passed by, I asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why I was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner. At this point, I was beginning to become very fed up. A supervisor later came round and asked if I was alright. I was fine (albeit tired), but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked. The supervisor was firm, but unapologetic, and asked me if I needed anything. I did not need anything, and she left me without further comment, her enquiry appearing pointless to me, as it solved nothing. Following this experience, I am unlikely to use Emirates again, which has left me thoroughly disillusioned with the company."," I had a poor experience on this flight.

104,"  The return journey from HKG to BKK reaffirmed the low quality of the airline that I experienced on the outward journey. Added to that however, was the 50 minutes to queue in the Online Check-in, having arrived at the airport more than the recommended 3 hours before flight departure. This is presumably as a result of only 2 check-in counters open for Online check-in. 2 were available for those who had not checked in, and these seemed to move more quickly.

113,"  I had a First Class Ticket booked with Emirates back in December 2019. I took the outbound flight but the inbound flight was canceled due to Covid-19. Emirates offered a voucher to change my flight for free. However the covid situation was taking too long, I wasn't planning to take any flight before the voucher expired. And then, I requested a refund in July 2023 and got emailed back from Emirates. They confirmed that the refund had been approved to Amex (my original payment card). I contacted Amex 10 working days later, and was told that Amex not received the refund. Amex had to fill a form to raise the case for investigation but they need details on ""the refund amount"". So I contacted Emirates to confirm whether they had refund the ticket or not, and how much was the amount refunded. Emirates representative advised that the other representative was chasing the refund and she refused to tell me any more details, nor give me information on the amount to be refund.

As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced.  During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits.  Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling.

120,"  The on-board internet simply does not work. If you complain, the supplier for Emirates, 'Sita for Aircraft' simply refuse to acknowledge that they failed to provide a service and issue a refund. It appears from multiple reviews that this happens often. Emirates themselves, apart from the non-existent internet and poor third party after-sales experience were pretty good, ample leg room, friendly staff, good selection of movies but poor food choice - fish or vegetables only. The check-in was also poor. I followed the check in signs for economy seats at Dubai airport T3, waited for around 20-30 mins before being told to check in at desk 5 (flights to USA) - i wasn't flying to the USA, how am i supposed to know to follow that sign?

121,"  I'm writing this review so others won't go through what went through. This airline has no accountability whatsoever. The day of my flight I was denied check in. The reason was that I had less than 6 month validity on my passport which was not required for my destination. The Emirates agent at the check-in booth told me he wouldn't let me on the flight and then offered my seat to a standby client. Because of this I missed my flight, I had to renew my passeport in less than 24h and lost 2 days stay at the hotel. I had to pay 300$+ ticket as penalty to board on the next flight not to mention the psychological distress I was put under (I have depression/anxiety disorder). I was travelling with a group and someone in my group has checked in with no problem with passport validity less than 6 months. When I contacted Emirates for refund they said the agent didn't declare the incident and put me as no show on the system although I was there in time with the group. I was told by Emirates that without the name of the agent they can do nothing about it. In short Emirates agents can freely deny you your flight manipulate the system and sell your seat to another person and you can do nothing about it.","  I'm writing this review so others won't go through what went through.

Lounge itself was nice and had just been refurbished, how ever food selection was average with several things having run out and not replaced. Flight it’s self was good but due to midnight departure staff were just going through the motions.

127,"  I'm motivated to write this critical review after multiple phone-hours with customer service agents with Emirates in the hope that others would benefit (and that Emirates would listen!). We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes. All I received were platitudes such as, 'we understand', 'that is awful', etc. over the phone but with no real help to process our claim.

128,"  Excellent service. I flew Dubai- B'Ham- Dubai in economy class. Emirates has common counters where you can check in your luggage. Initially, I was skeptical (particularly on the DXB-BHX route) but Emirates made no mistakes. This is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge. The flight departed on time, the crew had a smile and were quite professional. Food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class. There was another snack service followed by juices/hot drinks 1.5 hours before landing. The seating is quite good and has a seat [pitch of 32""). B777s in use by Emirates are getting old and you can see the signs. Their ICE system was excellent. I am not sure I would like the Business class seats here as they weren't lie-flat but I was flying economy. Families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using Polaroid cameras. The in-flight wifi was free for text messaging using WhatsApp, even in economy if you have Skywards membership. My only complaint during the trip is that the plane was parked far off and required considerable walking at Terminal 3 in Dubai to reach immigration (which was a breeze). Overall, it was a great experience but flights are quite expensive compared to the competition.","  Excellent service. I flew Dubai- B'Ham- Dubai in economy class.

129," What a disappointment. Emirates is lauded as having one of the best inflight experiences in the world. They obviously spend a lot of money marketing the experience as such. The problem with this is that expectations are high. The hard product is good, all be it a little tatty. Service and food quality is poor. Options are limited and there is no dining in demand.

134,"  I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water. Juice/water/fruits ??","  I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates.

No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water.

137,"  I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor. All flights were expensive so I used an app to find some cheaper flights and booked on line. I must mention that I checked with their terms and conditions to make sure I could call and change the flight to an unaccompanied minor. Firstly I never received the itinerary so I called Emirates to get this sent. Secondly I could barely understand the operator as he mumbled and had a strong accent. Once I had the itinerary I then told them I needed the unaccompanied minor added. Because I had booked flights operated by Emirates but run by Qantas, I needed to call Qantas to make the change. So I called Qantas, they had no record of the flights, then told me I need to change through the airline I booked. I called Emirates again and explained, they then said I assure you it needs to be done by Qantas. I went back and forth from airline to airline multiple times until Emirates then said there is no way I can change to unaccompanied minor and Qantas would not change it either, I finally had enough and asked to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. I spoke to a supervisor who was not rude or anything but stated I’d need to cancel the flight, take the hit and rebook via phone. I don’t think so, referring to their website that says booking electronically then adding a service is perfectly acceptable. So now I have return tickets in my daughters name that we can’t use. This is bordering on criminal if not unethical, Airlines are supposed to be helpful not members of the “Wit” family","  I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor.

141,"  I strongly recommend flying with a different airline if you have an infant. Emirates are not what they used to be and their customer care is horrific. I booked a bassinet for my baby which means booking a middle seat. I booked 3 months in advance so I had the pick of any seat, yet I checked the requirements for a bassinet and was confident I would be allowed one. Obviously for my baby to have a bassinet was more important than me having a comfortable seat so the sacrifice was made and I chose a seat with a bassinet. Upon boarding I was told my baby was too big for a bassinet. I told them she meets the height and weight requirements but they insisted she was too big. They told me if a baby is capable of reaching the bottom of the bassinet they could push out the press studs and collapse the bassinet, implying that only babies who don’t move in their sleep are able to use a bassinet. This left me in complete distress knowing I had 15 hours ahead of me with my infant on my knee on a front row middle seat. I was in a fit of tears and the flight attendant said sorry there’s nothing I can do. Our flight was at 9pm so I had already been awake all day and had no sleep the whole flight. I couldn’t eat because the fold out tray from the chair arm wouldn’t fit in front of me and my baby and the one time she was asleep my meal had two hairs in it. I was so upset I just gave them my tray back (to which they huffed at me for having to take it when they weren’t ready) and didn’t eat for the journey. I then had a 3 hour wait in Dubai before another 7 hour flight. I asked if I could change this seat and they said no the flights was full which caused me to have a panic attack and almost faint after no food or sleep for a very long time. No one attended to me except one passenger and we had to get on the plane and sit in a middle seat for another 7 hours with no sleep. There was a nice attendant on the second flight who allowed me to stand up and eat a danish while my baby slept on my chair. Honestly if I could cancel my return flight and book with another airline I would. I will never ever fly with emirates again.","  I strongly recommend flying with a different airline if you have an infant. Emirates are not what they used to be and their customer care is horrific.

Menu was badly selected like there was no balance nor properly matched dishes. It didn't taste good either. Snacks were bad too. In both my flights, from London to Dubai and Dubai to Phuket I had same issues with the seat. First seats are low quality shakes wiggles a lot and offers low comfort. Only good thing was leg space. In both flights infotainment system was broken. Cabin crew tried numerous resets which took 30mins each. On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink. Cabin crew is always busy at the back and hard to get anything. They didn't offer socks, travel package. Just blanket and small pillow. I did fly with etihad, Quatar airways and Turkish airlines. Emirates was the worst. Turkish airlines offers the best food and customer service. I will never fly with Emirates. Lead cabin crew had no English and wifi is not free as they advertise.

145,"  I recently flew with Emirates from Sydney to Prague, via Dubai. The flights between Sydney and Dubai were in the new Premium Economy Class, sadly not yet available between Dubai and Prague. The economy class legs of the journey were satisfactory given they were only 6 hours in duration. However the Premium Economy flights were definitely a significant improvement, and in my opinion well worth the extra expense. Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats, excellent service, improved food quality and presentation and the bathrooms in a different league from the economy class product. In every way using Premium Economy class greatly improved my travel experience and turned the long journey into something enjoyable, rather than an endurance test. My hope is that this product can be rolled out to more routes in the near future. Highly recommend for those like myself who dread the long journey from Australia to Europe.","  I recently flew with Emirates from Sydney to Prague, via Dubai.

On the first flight EK 513 from Delhi to Dubai, I notified my situation and asked to the crew that, since the connection time to my flight to Barcelona was 1 hour 55 minutes, they would check that I was picked up from the plane quickly. The cabin staff told me ""don't worry"". Upon arrival they told me that I had to wait because there was no finger but stairs. After a while and seeing how nervous I was getting, a first class attendant approached me and told me that she would take my luggage and help me down the stairs because if I didn't take the bus on the runway, I wouldn't make it to the flight to Barcelona. On the bus there was a person in an Emirates uniform who I asked if she could help me when I got to the terminal to locate a wheelchair because he had very short connection time, he refused! Upon arrival at the terminal there were no wheelchairs, I made it with difficulty to the wheelchair request point and, from there they had me getting on and off several buggies and, luckily, the driver of the last buggy helped me with the luggage to Arrive at the plane after the closing time of the flight.

165,"  My experience onboard Emirates was a good one. The IFE was great, food was good and so was the cabin service. The airline though sent a 777 with the old cabin from Bengaluru to Dubai, which was not so bad, but made me a bit disappointed. The next flight from Dubai to Washington DC also was served by a Boeing 777, but with the latest cabin with a new, big, modern IFE screen and a brighter cabin, which made a difference for the better. Apart from the old cabin, I found the legroom to be quite a bit lesser than what I initially thought. Perhaps I should try the Airbus A380 if I am to get a better experience. But the 777s were also equally nice, at least in Economy. Since I was flying during Covid time, I was also a tad bit disappointed over no hot towels and menu cards in Economy. Overall, I would definitely recommend this airline.","  My experience onboard Emirates was a good one. The IFE was great, food was good and so was the cabin service.

175,"  In December 2022 I travelled from Sydney to Dubai with Emirates First Class. I was contacted by the Emirates car transfer company prior to collection and informed them the number of passengers and luggage, but the car that arrived was too small and the driver was rude and unhelpful. Check-in was ok, but was not given an express pass and was directed to the business lounge not first class as available for gold members. At boarding time most of the other passengers from economy were boarded before the priority boarding due to lack of staff at the gates. After boarding I asked for my meal after take off but after 1.5 hours nothing had arrived I had to call twice before someone came to me, it took nearly another 20 min before I got my meal, As my teenage children were flying in Premier economy, I checked on them but on both occasions was rudely told to return to seat my by the same cabin crew member and on the second occasion was questioned about my seat, this was totally embarrassing. After landing in Dubai I was not able to enter the first-class lounge unless I paid $420.00 for my son for 20 min, my sons airmiles were missing at the end of the trip. I complained to Emirates about the service and after 8 weeks was told the transfer company was a third party, boarding was a strict policy, that it was my fault not to help myself to some sandwiches, policy on lounge entry, and that my son was not an air miles member (he is), No apology or mention of the cabin crew behaviour, after responding to their response I basically told by them basically Emirates did not care about my business (over $250k) per year.

The seats at the economy class is good, on par with other airlines. The cabin crews are nice and helpful and it seems the cabin crew are all coming from different countries but I don't any Emirati or Middle Eastern cabin crew. I wish there are more Asian food options (I'm Thai) on food instead of Middle Eastern/Arabic food. The inflight entertainment was okay, nothing surprising.

182,"  After being a Skywards member for many years, this time I requested wheelchair assistance. I flew Bangkok to Cape Town and returned from Johannesburg to Bangkok. I was expecting the wheelchair transfers in Dubai to be the usual high standard. Instead of a wheelchair waiting for me as the aircraft opened its doors in Dubai, I was told to walk along the sky bridge and to find a desk that would then provide a wheelchair. I did this and found a group of men who were obviously employed to provide wheelchair assistance standing around talking to each other and did not seem to have any list of passengers who required this assistance. I was told there were not enough wheelchairs and told to walk to another area where there was no seating and I had to stand until an assistant arrived with a wheelchair. I sat in this while we went from one building to another and in the airport train. I was unceremoniously dumped at the seating area at the gate and a very long walk down a corridor and onto the skybridge awaited me. The woman sitting next to me kindly asked it I would like to lean on her arm as we traversed this onto the aircraft. I don't know what would have happened if I had been unable to walk at all. The return trip from Johannesburg to Bangkok was even worse. When we landed in Dubai there were no wheelchairs and I was asked to walk a long distance and up an escalator to an area of seating and told to wait for a golf cart. This did not appear. I was sitting next to a woman whose mobility was even worse than mine and she was in a great deal of pain. We were then told we had to walk to some other area, so the woman and I shuffled off leaning on each other vowing never to fly with Emirates again. This time we were told to wait in an area with no seats at all for a golf cart. I noticed a folded wheelchair up against a wall so I unfolded it and put my companion in it. She was most grateful. No assistance at all from the employees whose job it was to provide assistance. Eventually a golf cart came and I got in. Then there were discussions amongst the so-called assistants, and I was told to get out and wait for a different golf cart. I was the only one in this golf cart and was dumped at the correct gate where I had to walk down the sky bridge to the plane. As I get older I will increasingly need to require wheelchair assistance when I travel alone. But the appalling way I and others were treated at Dubai Airport will certainly influence me when I choose which airline to fly in the future. I go to Africa regularly. Next time I will choose Ethiopian Airlines. If you need wheelchair assistance at Dubai Airport, do not fly with Emirates.","  After being a Skywards member for many years, this time I requested wheelchair assistance.

189,"  We were scheduled to depart at 10.30pm I was travelling with my 10 year old son. We moved away from the gate and was told there was a technical issue so we had to return. Over an hour later we were told it was resolved and we left the gate again. As we were taxiing the pilot came on and said that Narita Airport had decided to conduct runway maintenance so we had to return to the gate again. This was the first problem - this was a lie. Narita Airport does not allow any aircraft to take off after midnight, this is why we could not take off and there is no way that Emirates did not know this. We returned to the gate and waited for an hour with no information. Then they said they would serve dinner - this is at 1am! I had no desire to eat dinner at 1am. With no further information we were told we had to deplane at 3am - so nearly five hours on the tarmac - and the ground staff would deal with us when we got off the plane. When we got off the plane, I was handed a sleeping bag with no explanation. When I asked they said we had to sleep at the gate. Eventually we were told that the flight might depart at 3pm the next day - 17 hours after the scheduled departure. No accommodation was provided or even offered. They announced breakfast at 9.30 am by which time was son was starving hungry anyway, so I had already paid for breakfast myself. Breakfast was a small piece of pizza bread and some water. There was no lunch. They did rebook my connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester, however we had already missed Christmas Eve by this point which was the whole reason we were leaving on December 23rd. Now, I understand that technical issues occur. I can even understand that we might be delayed by 17 hours. However, being forced to wait on the plane for 5 hours when they knew we were never going to depart, being lied to about the reason, not being given accommodation or proper food - these are all things I cannot accept and so wrote a complaint. My request for compensation has now been denied three times. They have said that Article 9 of their Conditions of Carriage says that they do not guarantee departure dates or times. If that is the case - how can any customer trust them to depart at a time and date that they paid for? Good food, good seats, good entertainment system, mediocre cabin crew. Absolutely appalling customer service. Every customer should think twice about using Emirates unless they are happy to be treated very unfairly when something does wrong.","  We were scheduled to depart at 10.30pm I was travelling with my 10 year old son.

194,"  My recent experience with them has been quite disappointing. The cabin crew are less friendly than I remember them to be years back, especially the male crew. I experienced this on all four legs of my recent journey. They felt like more of bouncers (i.e the men), as they didn't smile, weren't friendly or approachable, and instead of telling me ""this way, please,"" as I have always been used to during boarding, one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction, without uttering a word. I found this to be a bit rude. To add to this, some crew members on various legs of my trip didn't offer me a beverage during snacktime, while they offered my neighbours some. And it's not because I had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested. They glanced at me and somehow decided I wouldn't be interested in a cuppa? This happened three different times! I will continue to fly with them as they offer some of the best prices. However, i do hope to see friendlier faces in future.","  My recent experience with them has been quite disappointing.

195,"  My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didn’t order it, Then why was it an option and it didn’t have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didn’t eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasn’t warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight. They say Emirates is a number 1 airline in the world and flying them is almost a privilege, but I disagree, Sorry.","  My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.

196," Though Emirates only operates a handful of flights to and from Milan, it maintains a nice, spacious lounge with ample seating and good selections of food. I could walk around and pick any seat I want in the lounge without having to sit next to strangers. Tables in the dining area were quickly cleared and cleaned after guests left, so they were always ready for the next guests. One unique thing about Emirates was that I could board directly from the lounge, which made things much easier. On board, the A380 was nice. Every seat had a minibar, which was nice. Emirates does not offer full turndown service the way Qatar Airways does, but a mattress pad was provided (like on Japan Airlines) to make a more comfortable bed. The gender specific amenity kit, by Bvlagri, was very nice and useful. Food was good in general, and wine selection was ahead of other airlines, but service was slow and a bit inconsistent.

198,"  First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing. A very early pre-boarding process in Amsterdam, while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned. So 500 People squeezed into a waiting area for an hour. Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew. All the purser could say that “it wasn't their fault”. Overall, all facilities and procedures are quite average, food and drinks are ok. (Drinks actually very nice), crew was a mix of friendly, hard-working people and some who couldn’t care less.","  First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing.

199," This was not a very good experience. Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to “no space” on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and what’s worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I don’t remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. I’m not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didn’t seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and that’s how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something. For some weird reason, the much advertised On Air WiFi did not work which took another point out. "," This was not a very good experience.

200,"  I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of £100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to.

202,  I always travel by Emirates and liked it but this was my first time traveling with my 14 months old baby. The seat I got was too small to fit us both. I didn’t know I have to carry my baby even when he’s asleep. I asked for bassinet and they said if baby’s legs are not straight while lying in bassinet then it’s not for the baby. I had to carry him throughout the flight because he was mostly asleep. When they provided me meal I couldn’t open my table as while holding baby table couldn’t be opened. I barely ate a little and gave up. Meal for baby was also not provided although it was included in the ticket. It was a huge disappointment. I couldn’t use inflight entertainment either for baby because there was no room.,  I always travel by Emirates and liked it but this was my first time traveling with my 14 months old baby.

On one of the legs, the flight attendant set my table for brunch and the actual brunch arrived 45 minutes later, during lunch time. And my vegan brunch was just a Chia seed pudding which was probably dumped into a bowl from a Mason jar so not sure why the delay.

211," Bangkok to Frankfurt via Dubai. The service on board was great. The touchscreen of the board entertainment system is on some planes are better than on others. The movie collection was vast but didn't fit my taste. My seat wasn't locked. So, it changed position without pushing the button. However, those minors didn't bother me because of the good value and the great staff. What bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the Emirates on ground service. Emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the Covid-19 pandemic for three years (what was great). However, our daughter became 13 years old during that time and a new more expensive adult ticket was needed for her. However, we saved about 150 Euro for her previous ticket, we had to add another 600 Euro for the new ticket. To get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants. On the way back, we had to pay additional 217 Euro for overweight. That was new for us, because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase. Maybe it is standard nowadays, but every weight scale is different, therefore I think airlines good except two kilos more per suitcase. Families seem to be disadvantaged in this concern. They count the overweight as total. If family members check in individually, they could save a few bucks."," Bangkok to Frankfurt via Dubai. The service on board was great.

One of the check in ladies at Copenhagen refused to let me carry on my carry on baggage, despite having taken 12 other flights, including 2 other Emirates flights with no problems on this trip. I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less.  It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times. The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead. All in all, for an airline that I was so excited to fly with, it hasn't been a great experience and I will be looking at other airlines before flying Emirates again that's for sure.","  The service I expected from a low cost carrier, not one of the supposedly best airlines in the world.

215,"  A very cramped journey from Bali to Dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and I am only 5 ft 2. The pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely. With just a 1 hour transit in Dubai I hopped onto the A380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall. The air hostess on this flight were not as friendly. A particular air hostess kept telling me off because I crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle, I mean we were so squished. I fell asleep and they didn’t serve me the first meal, or even offer a drink when I woke up, they just past me as if I didn’t exist. The second meal was an excellent portion size, the food could barely fit on the tray. I particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola, and cheese and biscuits - for the hot food it wasn’t impressive. I had better food on cheaper airlines. The air hostess were OK about re filling my water bottle. All in all I think I would try another airline for this long journey next time, just a few bad vibes from the staff with regards to meals and sleeping as mentioned above.","  A very cramped journey from Bali to Dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and I am only 5 ft 2.

The flight schedule was changed and instead of 3 hours bearable lay-over, now there was a 11 hour lay-over. They gave hotel accommodation but I was still worried due to my mother’s health and age.  While returning from DFW and reaching DXB, they told my mother that she doesn’t have wheelchair booked. Due to less passengers, upon asking for help, they agreed to provide her wheelchair but what if the flight was packed? Strike 3: I talked to customer service about their initial refusal to provide a wheelchair and they had no answer but “Her wheelchair is booked”. So I asked customer service for the instructions that my mother should follow to get back to the airport from hotel and again the only answer to all my questions was “Our staff will be there to assist her everywhere”. After her hotel stay, my mother was dropped at the road-side of the airport with nobody to help. She asked questions to the passing-by people and thank God she was able to find her way into the airport wheelchair counter. I genuinely liked Emirates but this is very disappointing and inconvenient especially given that mother is a senior citizen.

237,"  After being concerned about our Qantas BC flight to Singapore with their issues, we were really looking forward to flying Emirates BC for the 1st time. Qantas blew Emirates out of the water. Worst business class ever. Really disappointed. You pay a lot to fly business class, so the expectation that something as simple as the food to be hot should be expected. Both flights the food was Luke warm. Can't stand cold food. It maybe the size of the A380 business class, but the whole set up seemed cold. Took off, and it was like a conveyor belt. Seat cushion on for sleep. Food orders taken. Place mat down. Crew were like robots, zero warmth. Qantas do the same, but just felt totally different. More customer interaction and dare I say warmth. 777 flight was a little better but the food was still cold. Sorry unacceptable in business class or even economy for that matter. Not looking forward to our flight from Europe back to Singapore in 6 weeks. When you save to fly business class, when the airline gets it wrong you feel ripped off. Yes they got us there in one piece with our luggage so I suppose I should be happy with that. We get to try Singapore Airlines and Turkish Air BC on this trip as well. So these flights on Emirates I dare say will be our last.

240,"  Since it was sudden sandstorm on Sunday 14August 2022,our flight was delayed from Bahrain and then Dubai too. Wen we arrived Dubai Airport then Emirates staff gave us Boarding passes and meal vouchers for another rebooking which was 6 hours later and I asked for lounge or some waiting areas from the staff since I carrying 1 month infant with me along 1 child, she denied saying that lounges are all occupied because all flights are delayed. I again understand that lounge may not be available but she could have shown some empathy and could have tried from her end to facilitate us by saying let me check if possible. I was not informed that there will be no announcements on this airport and she did not even tell that your gate may be in another building for which you will have to go by bus or metro which takes another 30-40 minutes at least. Somehow I found a place to feed my baby which was quite far but concourse B was mentioned on my Boarding pass so I thought its near only we went to relax n feed my baby and later our gate was changed to another building and I did not know it will take such long time to reach there.

247,"  I have flown Emirates extensively in the Lisbon-Dubai route and I find their product rather consistent. This last time check-in took a bit too much than I would expect for Business, but security fast-track works well and is convenient. In Lisbon Emirates uses the TAP lounge which is a bummer as other than being very crowded at all times, it is located before passport control (Schengen area) which forces people to leave much earlier than boarding start. If flying Business in the Boeing 777-300 do choose the front mini-cabin (first 2 rows before the door) as all the 300+ Economy passengers board through the door before the aft cabin leading to an annoying 1h boarding process with people passing by. Food and crew are usually great and very helpful and friendly. At Dubai very easy process to go through priority passport control and to reach the complimentary limo service, all very efficient. I have found some drivers to be quite rude and/or driving dangerously - Emirates should improve their standards for this personnel. All in all, Emirates is one of the few airlines offering a truly distinctive premium service, from the moment you leave home until you set your feet at your destination hotel. I will continue flying with them.","  I have flown Emirates extensively in the Lisbon-Dubai route and I find their product rather consistent.

If flying Business in the Boeing 777-300 do choose the front mini-cabin (first 2 rows before the door) as all the 300+ Economy passengers board through the door before the aft cabin leading to an annoying 1h boarding process with people passing by. Food and crew are usually great and very helpful and friendly. At Dubai very easy process to go through priority passport control and to reach the complimentary limo service, all very efficient. I have found some drivers to be quite rude and/or driving dangerously - Emirates should improve their standards for this personnel. All in all, Emirates is one of the few airlines offering a truly distinctive premium service, from the moment you leave home until you set your feet at your destination hotel. I will continue flying with them.","[('flown', 'v'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('extensively', 'r'), ('Lisbon-Dubai', 'n'), ('route', 'n'), ('find', 'v'), ('product', 'n'), ('rather', 'r'), ('consistent', 'a'), ('.', None), ('last', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('check-in', 'a'), ('took', 'v'), ('bit', 'n'), ('much', 'a'), ('would', None), ('expect', 'v'), ('Business', 'n'), (',', None), ('security', 'n'), ('fast-track', 'n'), ('works', 'v'), ('well', 'r'), ('convenient', 'a'), ('.', None), ('Lisbon', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('uses', 'v'), ('TAP', 'n'), ('lounge', 'n'), ('bummer', 'n'), ('crowded', 'v'), ('times', 'n'), (',', None), ('located', 'v'), ('passport', 'n'), ('control', 'n'), ('(', None), ('Schengen', 'n'), ('area', 'n'), (')', None), ('forces', 'v'), ('people', 'n'), ('leave', 'v'), ('much', 'r'), ('earlier', 'a'), ('boarding', 'v'), ('start', 'n'), ('.', None), ('flying', 'v'), ('Business', 'n'), ('Boeing', 'n'), ('777-300', 'a'), ('choose', 'v'), ('front', 'a'), ('mini-cabin', 'n'), ('(', None), ('first', 'a'), ('2', None), ('rows', 'n'), ('door', 'n'), (')', None), ('300+', None), ('Economy', 'n'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('board', 'n'), ('door', 'n'), ('aft', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('leading', 'v'), ('annoying', 'v'), ('1h', None), ('boarding', 'v'), ('process', 'n'), ('people', 'n'), ('passing', 'v'), ('.', None), ('Food', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('usually', 'r'), ('great', 'a'), ('helpful', 'a'), ('friendly', 'a'), ('.', None), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('easy', 'a'), ('process', 'n'), ('go', 'v'), ('priority', 'n'), ('passport', 'n'), ('control', 'n'), ('reach', 'v'), ('complimentary', 'a'), ('limo', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), (',', None), ('efficient', 'a'), ('.', None), ('found', 'v'), ('drivers', 'n'), ('quite', 'r'), ('rude', 'a'), ('and/or', 'n'), ('driving', 'v'), ('dangerously', 'r'), ('-', None), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('improve', 'v'), ('standards', 'n'), ('personnel', 'n'), ('.', None), (',', None), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('one', None), ('airlines', 'n'), ('offering', 'v'), ('truly', 'r'), ('distinctive', 'a'), ('premium', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), (',', None), ('moment', 'n'), ('leave', 'v'), ('home', 'v'), ('set', 'v'), ('feet', 'n'), ('destination', 'n'), ('hotel', 'n'), ('.', None), ('continue', 'v'), ('flying', 'v'), ('.', None)]","  fly Emirates extensively Lisbon-Dubai route find product rather consistent . last time check-in take bit much would expect Business , security fast-track work well convenient .

248,"  My brother in Kenya died suddenly in a construction accident so I had to get a flight home quickly as funerals happen quickly in Kenya. We found a suitable flight with Emirates although it was about triple what I normally pay for a planned flight home. At Birmingham the checkin staff were not very helpful and then the flight to Amsterdam was delayed but I was told not to worry, I would still get my onwards flight from Schipol to Nairobi. However, when I arrived at Amsterdam my flight had departed. I was offered a flight 24 hours later but turned it down as I would miss my brother’s funeral and I would be devastated. I was offered and accepted an alternative flight via Entebbe, Uganda, which I accepted. However, when I arrived at Entebbe I was refused boarding on the flight to Nairobi - Emirates had messed up. I had no money for an alternative flight and no roaming on my phone so I Whattsapp’d my husband in UK and he phoned up Emirates Dubai office at great expense and after half an hour convinced the call handler to book me onto a later flight to Nairobi.

249," Service is below sub standard. I travelled with my 2 daughters of 2 and 7 years. I bought my seat at the time of booking and the system wouldn’t let me to do the same for my daughters. At the time of online check in, I found out that my daughters were seated 7 rows ahead of me on their own which shocked me. Furthermore, I raised my concerns to the officer at the check-in desk. Her seat allocation was more terrible than the system. She allocated me in the middle seat, 2 year at the aisle and 7 year aisle right across making her to sit with a stranger. I was frightened to hear that bad news and had to escalate the issue to the supervisor. Finally, after 20-25 minutes of waiting, supervisor made me (compulsion) to sit with my daughters 7 seats ahead of my paid chosen seat. At least, it was a big relief for me before boarding. Money paid for my chosen seat was gone into Emirates account and no refund was made until now. More paper work following to claim it and a waste of time, so let Emirates enjoy that undeserved money. Service offered by the airline was below standard when compared to the rest of Middle Eastern Carriers and other standard carriers. Families travelling with kids were of least to no concern by the crew. However, I have to admit that Emirates managed to arrive the destination on time. On the return leg, my luggage is not delivered yet or lost on the way. Another issue to deal with Emirates now. Service had gone from standard to pathetic. I need to think million one times to make another booking with Emirates. Families travelling with kids are not recommended to choose this airline. More dissatisfaction occurred when reporting the above mentioned incidents to the customer support. Hardly any apologies to little reassurance from them too.

250,"  Checked in at Bergen for flight Oslo with SAS connecting to Dubai with Emirates. Arrived early. Waited at gate in Oslo before flight started to board and was 2nd in line. Bags were checked all the way through to Dubai, where we would then have a rest and get a flight to Melbourne the following day. Attempted to board and told our tickets had been cancelled - by us! Somehow in the air from Bergen, we decided to cancel our own tickets and delay seeing our 4 children and give up a weekend in Dubai - seems unlikely. Argued the point but no interest in listening to us and the flight left without us. We were not told where to go, who to contact, how to get any help and we had to wait for hours for our luggage to be returned to us after it was taken off the plane. We spent two days stranded in Oslo airport with no help from Emirates at all. Our travel agent confirmed that it was in fact Emirates that cancelled our tickets - for being a “no show” which is 100% wrong and we can prove this. We spent money on hotel, footed and lost money in Dubai from prebooked accommodation. Emirates would not give us anything in compensation. Flight home was empty / half full. No offer of upgrade or anything at all from customer service (or lack of customer service!). After a terrible flight home, straight through to Melbourne we were now a day late due to the airline. We lost a days work and had to re-schedule deliveries at additional cost to our business. After several attempts to write, email and call emirates customer service on return to Melbourne, we have had zero response! The lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful. I was prepandemic a frequent international flyer and in 20 years I have never seen such a poor display. I will never fly this airline again. Emirates is an appalling company that cares nothing for the customer experience. They do not care for Australian passengers - it’s all about looking after their own profits. Fly at your own risk as they will cost you money and care less. Oh - actually they did offer us a special treat from business class, how could I forget they asked if we wanted a cappuccino from a machine. I don’t drink coffee.","  Checked in at Bergen for flight Oslo with SAS connecting to Dubai with Emirates. Arrived early. Waited at gate in Oslo before flight started to board and was 2nd in line.

251,"  This is the most unpleasant business class travel experience I have ever had.

The WIFI (cost 19.9 usd) I bought onboard doesn't work most of the time. When I went to the toilet shortly before landing, the attendant reluctantly open the door for me. But he kept pushing by saying ""do it really quick"" and even knocked the door irritatedly. He didn't apologise even after I asked him to use proper English and better manner.

258,"  In the last 4-years, Emirates customer service has become one of the worst. I doubt they are any better than a 2-star service. Their airport staffs are either rude or cold. Their in-flight food service is mediocre. Although, the food is above average. They offer minimal service when it comes to offering water or drinks during the flight. I tried upgrading using family account points, a feature with Emirates. It is more or less a scam scheme designed to pool all your points in your family account. The idea is you can upgrade your journey or family members' journey using the family account. However, you cannot access these points when you want to upgrade. So you are left with no points in your account and storing all your points in your family account, and you can't use them. Emirates airport staffs and cabin crews are so poorly trained. Both Airline check-in staff, Cabin Crew and support staff have no clue how the family account works. I heard 4-different versions of the policies.

265,"  At Algiers airport, the lounge is lifeless.  In the plane, the power receptacle is broken on my seat but luckily no one was sitting next to me to use his. The live TV did not work and the images are distorted. The live TV displays a few frames then freezes for a minute or so before displaying more frames. I was trying to watch the football game between ManU and Chelsea. The food (we were fasting) they left by your seat and then it took another 15 minutes to bring nuts and drinks after Maghrib. I just wanted soup for Iftar. In addition, when I was asked to choose my entree, it was not available. The seat I had 11A was very noisy. Usually they distribute pouches with socks, toothbrush and toothpaste and a blind mask in addition to ear plugs which would have been helpful. After all this is business class. The only bright thing in this upgrade is that the hostesses were brilliant and even tolerated my displeasure with these inconveniences in a nice way. In any case, this is the worst business class experience flying Emirates ever. Most likely it will be my last at least on this route. This is their reply: Dear Mr Boutrid, Thank you for your correspondence of 31 May 2022 regarding Emirates flight EK 758 from Algiers to Dubai on 28 April. I am concerned to learn of your disappointment with the lounge at Algiers airport. This lounge is operated by a service provider. Regrettably, not all lounge operators have the selection of food and beverages or ambience that we offer in our Emirates Lounges. However, your feedback is noted and has been shared with the relevant team for their information. Through emirates.com we do advise customers that for technical reasons we are unable to provide Wi-Fi, mobile phone, mobile data and live television services on every flight, or guarantee a continuous service. Emirates' liability is therefore limited. However, I acknowledge that this added to your disappointment. With regard to your request for the mixed grill, we always aim to match the quantity of choices with the predicted passenger preferences. While we do our utmost to meet all passenger requests, sometimes there may be shortages of a particular meal choice due to previous passenger selection. Shortages of a particular meal are continuously monitored in order to adjust ratios accordingly for future flights. It is my understanding that got your first choice of starter (potato soup), your preferred dessert, the chocolate caramel tarte, and opted for the beef meal instead. On another note, Business Class kit bags are offered on flights over 3 hours 30 minutes that depart between the hours of 22:00 to 05:00 and on all flights over 9 hours regardless of the departure time. However, certain toiletry items are available in the lavatories for the comfort of our passengers and may also be requested from our cabin crew. I regret that you did not enjoy our product offering as much as we would have liked.","  At Algiers airport, the lounge is lifeless.

266,"  It was a round trip with Emirates from Delhi to Dubai and antagonistic experience in both journeys. Ground staff at Dubai was very rude and unhelpful whereas in India the check in was way easier despite of huge rush. We were stuck and struggling for self check in (which we were guided again and again by the limited staff available) and finally after half an hour when our check in baggage got stuck on the belt and we again have to helplessly ask for help for which the lady at the counter replied us to wait for 2-3 minutes. After 10 minutes when nobody turned up my husband reminded the same lady at the counter that we need help to which she replied I am on some other report and we should proceed towards manual counter. We were shocked! My husband reminded her that our baggage is stuck to which she responded with irritation and called some technical staff to provide our baggage. Then we proceeded towards manual counter where again with technical glitches our check in was done in half an hour when all our documents were properly in place. In short more than an hour to check in at Dubai airport with Emirates without rush whereas in India within an hour we were done with check in, security and immigration! My suggestion to the passengers travelling from Emirates please don't expect soft spoken and helpful staff specially at Dubai airport and have spare time in hand to bear with the glitches.","  It was a round trip with Emirates from Delhi to Dubai and antagonistic experience in both journeys.

Return flight on A6-EEA was disappointing because the aircraft was showing his age: my suite was completely worn out, sliding doors broken. EK should pay attention to this details and make sure everything is renewed especially in premium cabins where there is too much difference between aircraft to aircraft for A380's in their fleet. The food was very good quality in both legs. JFK-MXP flight was below average because of the service that was either too slow for the main meal or too rushed during breakfast.

282,"  A business trip from Sydney to Zurich and then back to Brisbane, code share with Qantas. Things that impressed me included the superb food and wine on all sectors (incl a nice printed menu and wine list), the wonderful Emirates First Class Lounges in Dubai (especially their prime lounge), the speedy and efficient boarding and the good cabin crews. Not so good was trying to get to a toilet in the middle of the night and having to make my way past lots of drunken passengers filling the bar area at the back of the A380 - which is also the area where the toilets are. I suggest this Lounge area could be made a barista coffee lounge instead (as much as I like a glass of wine). All flights pretty much on time.

283,"  Only the second time I choose to fly Emirates, so I will not make a fast decision as to use this airline again or not. But I have to say that in all the years I have been flying business, the CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace. From the chaotic boarding in Paris when all first and business class passengers were held at the gate for 25 minutes (apparently for no reasons except that some sort of VIP showed up at some point and cut the line), without so much as an announcement from the person in charge. Once everyone was on board, the first announcement from the captain was about an hour delay in getting a takeoff slot. As we pushed back, their APU went out, no lights and aircon and back to the gate. Then some very vague information from the flight deck on some repairs being done, and another slot waiting time. Anyway the whole deal lasted 3 hours. Ok, that is a technical problem, it happens and that is the way it is. What bothered me during the whole time was the complete disdain of the cabin crew for the passengers. As a matter of facts, most of them seemed to enjoy the delay and were having some very long and loud conversations with some apparent friends in the aisles. The flight finally took off. And this is when the cabin crew showed its complete inability to handle the most basic service. Absolutely no care for the passengers, and except for some meal served in a hurry (during which I actually had to beg for a glass of wine previously ordered ) we only got to see them once in a while during the whole 7,5 hours. I want to think that this was a bad timing, or else. On the other end, the second leg of the flight from DXB to Moscow was excellent, and I actually found out how much was missing on the first leg then: Friendly and helpful cabin crew, good service. After all this is what we ask for in a flight! My rating will be below at 5/10. Zero for first leg, 10 for second leg.","  Only the second time I choose to fly Emirates, so I will not make a fast decision as to use this airline again or not.

Then our flight home from Amman to Dubai to Chicago, ended up being canceled again and now we are trying to change it because I have my sisters wedding the next day.

The digital menu was not working. I asked a cabin crew what was on the menu, and they stated to ask another crew member. Toilets were not clean and were smelly. I requested a drink in the galley from a cabin crew and he pointed to cups and a bottle of water and said 'get it yourself.' Cabin temperature was freezing cold. The seat was comfortable.

312,"  We had the most horrific experience with Emirates travelling from Spain to Sydney. Our flight was delayed by an hour from Barcelona. We let the crew know multiple times that we had a connection to catch. They told us not to worry, there'll be ground crew waiting for us once we land and will make sure we don't miss our connection. But #Emirates had already cancelled our next flight after an hr into our seven 7 hr flight, this was 6 hrs before landing. Once we landed there was no crew waiting so we ran to catch the connection until mid-way the #Emirates personnel appeared telling us about the cancellation. They're rude and ignorant to the fact that we were sleep deprived, tired and could not grasp why no effort was made to make up for the 1 hour delay or contact the ground crew. Also both my partner & I had picked up a cold virus (not Covid, got the negative PCR) and felt horrible. We were both feverish, barely managing to speak and the crew treated us poorly. First they gave us seats far away from each other twice. I couldn't understand how they could make the same mistake twice. Second they told us we can't get the exit row seat, we'd paid extra for. They told me, it wasn't their responsibility to refund the money and I should request if from Emirates.  I just requested that we wouldn't be seated near any small babies and they said fine. They kept telling us to collect our luggage, but with the condition my partner and I were in and the fact that my feet had already started swelling up, it was impossible. So we said no. Since no one was helping and it was 3 am, we thought to go and check in to our hotel & sleep. We were already at our limits but thought we make the best of it, go visit the Dubai Expo and all. But things just started getting worst. We were in nightmarish state until we got home. We had to walk for an hour to get to the shuttle that would take us to the hotel. The Emirates crew at the Airport entrance couldn't help us with Expo tickets, cause they didn't care. We had been given one meal voucher per person for 24 hours. And the hotel had no amenities. After multiple arguments, the meal problem was fixed, which wasn't that useful cause the quality of the food was so bad that all the passengers in the hotel were ordering deliveries. We'd to go and buy clothes, toothbrush, deodorant, etc for ourselves which was a waste of money. The hotel couldn't even be rated at 2 stars and there was always at least one person arguing and shouting with the staff and complaining. We survived the whole ordeal and got to the plane to find couple of things that we were assured were fine, were actually not. We ended being seated beside a baby that cried for 10 hours of our flight without exaggeration, there were empty seats at the end of the plane, they just didn't bother to check for us. I did ask for a change of seat at the gate and in flight and every time I was told there were no empty seats. We arrived at Syd airport in a chaotic situation to collect our luggage. They'd given the wrong belt, so everyone spent an hour at luggage collection. ","  We had the most horrific experience with Emirates travelling from Spain to Sydney.

318,"  This was a poor experience from start to finish.  Arrived at the airport to find there was a four-hour delay to the flight. Emirates, however, did not check in bags so no one could go through security or otherwise move to an area with seats available (there were about 30 seats in the area for 200+ passengers). There was very little communication about what problem, if any, caused the delay. Ultimately, Emirates did begin check-in and then began a shuffle of repeated delays until, about seven hours later, Emirates cancelled the flight. Very little communication. ""Maybe there will be a flight tomorrow."" Called Emirates and no answer. Tried online chat without success. Ultimately turned to twitter to get rebooked (had onward flight). This in turn led to the agent trying to charge me an additional several thousand dollars because of fare differential between flying days. I pushed back hard on that, but got the sense Emirates simply sought to profit. Agent tried to put me on a flight in which I would miss my connection to a city served only once every five days by air. Emirates, unlike other airlines, won't book passengers on cancelled flights onto other airlines. Ultimately, Emirates added an additional flight the following day. Told us to get to airport four hours before, but then wouldn't check-in rebooked flight until two hours before so the two flights wouldn't get confused (why then have us in area with no seats and tell us to just stand there for several hours?). Onboard, seats were cramped. My child got a ""kids meal"" she didn't ask for which consisted of one burnt chicken nugget! Service was lackluster. I've flown more than two million miles on other airlines; Emirates was down near the bottom. Seems they are seeking to coast on their reputation but are no longer willing to do the bare minimum.","  This was a poor experience from start to finish.

325,"  We booked a trip from London to Muscat and then Muscat to Dubai for a week before returning to the UK. Emirates left us stranded in Muscat Airport. They had cancelled the flight and not even notified us of this cancellation. They had just put us on another flight 40 hours later without telling us. We turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist. There was no help desk at the airport, their App was down and we couldn't get through to customer service in Oman or the UAE. We tried calling customer service in the UK, and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later. Bearing in mind, we were having to use our UK mobiles abroad. We had another British couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing. I am over six months pregnant and this was meant to be a honeymoon for us because our original wedding and honeymoon were cancelled due to COVID. In the end we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there weren't any flights to the UAE for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when I was six months pregnant. We tried to complain in Dubai & we were told they couldn't do anything, we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the UK. I lodged a complaint & we have just received the below response, which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to FlyDubai. Firstly, they are part of the same group and secondly, we booked our tickets through Emirates & they took full payment for the whole itinerary. Therefore, we are their customer & we are nothing to do with FlyDubai. They offered us a measly 10,000 miles each, which costs them nothing & is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago. You need a min. 50-100K to upgrade. Emirates response: Thank for your correspondence and naturally, I regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport. I do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused, especially as I understand that you are pregnant. If I may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines. Although there is a partnership, Emirates and FlyDubai are two separate companies and Emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa. In this instance, the schedule change occurred to your flight from Muscat operated by FlyDubai; whilst I am not aware why their proposed flight EK2033 on 5 November was removed from their schedules in advance of travel, I would like to explain that unfortunately, there are rare occasions when these cannot be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. That being said, I note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of Emirates, as well as our partner FlyDubai. Whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline, I would suggest you contact your private travel insurers, as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations. Nevertheless, as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion, I have credited 10,000 goodwill miles to both your Skywards accounts. Miss May, I do hope that you will continue to choose Emirates in the future.","  We booked a trip from London to Muscat and then Muscat to Dubai for a week before returning to the UK.

327,"  Great and consistent service given by the crew, especially the steward serving the cabin from row 24 till 36. He helped with finding space in the overhead bins for cabin bags, was very friendly and motivated, and provided excellent service. During the entire flight he paid attention on passengers wearing their face mask, and made remarks to the ones not wearing it. In the past (before Covid19), I experienced some flights where service was lacking and unsatisfied, but this was a pleasant experience. Only negative point is the self check-in at Dubai Airport. People are guided to self check-in machines, also elderly and less frequent flyers, big families, and it takes very long time to have their check-in completed. Especially when they have excess baggage and already half of the bags have been send through. After completing check in, still have to queue up for passport and PCR verification at another Emirates desk, which makes the self check-in less convenient.

331,"  My wife and I reunited in Seychelles in August 2021 after being separated by the pandemic. We had planned to return to the Philippines where she is a citizen. Upon checking in for our first flight with Emirates, the supervisor said I needed a visa since I was a USA citizen. We attempted to explain that Philippines allows a visa on arrival for foreign spouses traveling with their Filipino spouse under the Balikbayan program. We showed our original apostilled marriage certificate as proof. However, the supervisor stated their system did not list these other provisions. We attempted to show multiple IATF resolutions that the Balikbayan had been allowed for several months, but she stated their system was updated daily. We agreed to follow up during normal business hours since this was Friday night. When I asked for documentation regarding my offloading, the supervisor indicated she couldn't provide this and that I'd have to make an online complaint. We were able to confirm by phone and email from the Bureau of Immigration that I should be allowed entry with my wife. We then showed this documentation to different Emirates supervisors at the airport who expressed confusion as to why I was prohibited to board in the first place. They agreed to independently confirm with Emirates airport staff in Philippines and the airport immigration officials. After they did, the airport supervisors confirmed we could rebook our flights and I would be able to board. We incurred thousands of dollars of extra travel expenses while obtaining this confirmation. And our connecting airlines refused to refund us our tickets without documentation as to why I was prohibited to board. When I requested this documentation from the online complaint system, I did not receive a clear response about the matter for 10 days. And that response added that the Balikbayan program didn't apply to me since I wasn't a Filipino even though I had already provided them emails from the Philippines BOI and the Emirates airport staff confirming I should be allowed to travel. I spent the next month continuing to email, resubmit documentation, and call anyone at Emirates who'd listen without any success. I did not receive any corrected documentation about the offloading, any financial compensation or flight credits, not even an apology acknowledging their initial mistake! Each time they continued to cordially reiterate that they took ""the matter seriously"" and ""have nothing further to add."" International travelers, especially Filipinos, should beware flying Emirates! They're playing the role of immigration without the knowledge or authority to do so. The online complaint system for Emirates is a travesty of a mockery! You can only upload 2 documents at a time. And you can't make multiple submissions without waiting for Emirates to reply. A week or two later. There's no one you can talk to about matters like this by phone either! I asked to speak with supervisors and managers multiple times without any success. Each time they referred me to the (useless) online complaint system. I don't even know why they bothered to send me delayed replies. They didn't address any concern or ever explain why the airport supervisors could approve me to rebook and board but the online customer service could make say something completely different.","  My wife and I reunited in Seychelles in August 2021 after being separated by the pandemic.

343,"  Was travelling to Nairobi after undergoing treatment, at Indira Gandhi International Airport we get to the check-in and the people there are so rude. They shout at you to do this and do that. The customer service from Emirates in that Airport is terrible to say the least. Anyway we get there and the guy checking us in tells us our booking is unavailable, that we need to leave the line - no explanation no nothing! We came to learn later that UAE had a new fly rule regarding long layovers for passengers from India. Now I don't know if they knew that but an apology would have been considerate regardless. We did pay over $1500 dollars for that ticket after all. Mind you we even had the e-ticket from Emirates with the confirmation and everything. Honestly I get much better customer service riding an Uber at 1/hundredth of the cost. Super disappointed.

344,"  A big scam! For a family of five with a little child with us, spending nine hours at the airport was really a very bad experience.

I spend more than one hour running with my kids and suitcases from one connection desk to another trying to get a lounge to spend the night but in vain.

348,"  Cabin crew were amazing, the flight from ORD to Dubai was great, the airplane was spotless, food was average, or below average but the economy seats and entertainment were above average. The flight from Dubai to Cairo was almost at equal standing, bathrooms were dirty most of the time though, the main problem that will prohibit me from recommending this airline to anyone is the experiences that I had with their ground crews in Chicago and in Dubai. Counter check-in and package drop off process overall with Emirates were the least efficient out there between the other lines that were checking in at the same time, needless to say that I spent almost 45-60 mins to finalize this step while the whole infamous TSA passport control process took less than 15 mins from start to finish on that busy day. When I finally made it to the check-in counter and I presented my Emirates compliant (not country-specific, Emirates ask for more than that) PCR test, they questioned whether or not I meet the time requirement simply because they compared the sample collection date and time in (CST) with the final destination departure time which was in Dubai local time without accounting for the time difference, after explaining that she took the test and disappeared for 10 mins before returning with the stamp of approval. Right after that she printed our 3 boarding passes for the trip to Dubai and beyond and asked to place our two carry-ons and two backpacks containing our personal items (our laptops, tablets, snacks, medicine, toys, and a change of cloth for our 4-year-old toddler) she stated that they will all be treated as carry-ons and that we were only allowed to bring two of them on board, and that if we don’t we will need to pay $200.00 in extra fees, or we can take our backpacks and check-in our carry-ons, she explained that this carry-ons restriction were a company policy imposed due to Covid, what does Covid has to do with the carry-ons and personal items allowance policy? I never had this experience ever with any other airline including my previous flights thru Emirates & Etihad, no one ever considered my laptop carrying bag as a carryon it was always listed as a personal item which I was allowed to bring on board to stow underneath my seat, I was in a state of shock and I told her that those carry-ons contained items with rechargeable batteries but that didn’t seem to sway her mind, I was in no position to argue at that point and took as much as I could from those rechargeable items form those carry-ons stuffing it into our backpacks just to follow my own safety protocols, on flight I saw many passengers boarding the airplane with their carry-ons and backpacks, and I highly doubt that they paid the $200 they wanted us to pay at the counter! Finally, the point where I completely snapped asking to see the supervisor on-site is when she-alongside another colleague of hers stated that my toddler' aviation approved child seat was not allowed inside the cabin and then they tried to charge me for an extra fourth seat claiming that to bring this on-board I’ll have to pay for an extra seat!

351,"  Their customer service is absolutely atrocious. Their website is not updated and they do not take responsibility for lacking to keep the passengers up to date with Covid travel requirements. I booked my flight two months in advance and checked the Emirates website daily in preparation for it. I am fully vaccinated but still needed a negative covid result, no problem, I got it done. When I got to the airport they said the covid result needs to be stamped. Turns out, all labs in the USA are FDA regulated and do not stamp their results for authorization. The only place that does so is inside the airport, by appointment and costs $175. I learned all of this as I was checking in for my flight. So there is obviously no time to make it and I had to miss my flight. Normally, airlines take responsibility for this and accommodate the passenger by rebooking them free of charge. Not Emirates, their reservations/customer service first said that the next flight is 11 days out, and then gave me no choice but to pay another $2000 to book a seat.

352,"  I am writing this review for my dad who flew Economy from Toronto to Dubai last Saturday. He booked Emirates hoping that they provide what they promise during this pandemic (safe flights, hygienic, booking half the flight's capacity, etc) but my dad had a horrible experience. The flight was fully booked which was quite bothersome at a time when everyone around the world are practising social distancing, the faucets in both the lavatories in his proximity were overflowing and I was told that the crew had been wearing the same masks throughout the 13-14 hour flight. This is an epitome of how Emirates treats its non-premium class as the ""cattle-class"" and that basic hygiene and comfort don't really matter for those who decide to fly at a lower rate. Really ashamed at Emirates for the inequality that they show. During these unprecedented times, they must take into account the passenger's health and safety rather than looking at profits. Please provide what you promise, Emirates. Your advertisements with the cabins being sanitized and having fully vaccinated crew (who knows?) really are just for attraction, aren't they?

I called the Emirates to book my new flight business flight that I paid extra for, this all happen on a Wednesday they had a flight leaving everyday to Toronto direct, but the only way I could get my business seat was if I updated it to a business flex, they would not honor this seat I paid for already, saying there is none available, They booked me in an economy class as I’m sitting on the plane right now with Extra business seats available I sit in economy. This airline is a rip off, they have the worst customer service, and all they care about is how to squeeze your money out of there customer, I recommend if you plan to take business class, don’t cancel that flight because your new flight will not be business, you will half to upgrade the seat you already paid for or go first class, be prepared to pay more money.

366,"  Emirates lost our bag and refuse to be held liable. 7 weeks ago me and my husband boarded a direct flight from Cairo to Dubai and our bag didn't arrive that had most of our essential and valuable items, we were staying for a month. We filed a report at the airport before leaving and we were told that someone will get back to us and that we should check the bag status with a reference number. We contacted them over 20 times through phone calls/emails requesting at least a deadline to know that our luggage is officially lost so we can re-purchase the lost items. On every occasion they promised that someone would get back to us directly, of course no one ever did! Thinking emails might work but we only got vague replies stating that its still under tracing and asked us to fill a form with the value of all items in our bag and someone will get back to us with either our luggage or to compensate us, but that never happened. 49 DAYS LATER, we finally decided to file an official complaint on their website to which they responded that our bag arrived Dubai airport.

My mother has been in Australia since January and was due to return in a couple of weeks. Whilst some things regarding Covid 19 are returning to a new normality - my mother is in her 90s and as such is in a particularly vulnerable group. The customer service representative was amazingly understanding and sympathetic. He changed things to enable an open return (with no penalty) and completely understood the need for her only to return when things return to a much more normal situation. I had expected to have to argue my case but the agent was so understanding. He went way beyond what I expected and couldn’t have been more helpful.

382,"  We had a business class flight from Auckland to Vienna booked for April 20. Obviously Corona crisis happened and we all know the story how almost all flights including this one was cancelled. The terms of the ticket clearly stated that they will refund full amount if they cancel the flight.

Thus they are refusing to refund and try to offer their vouchers instead. Being a business class flight for 4 persons it's a fairly substantial amount. Let's consider the facts for a moment. Changing contract terms one-sided after the contract has been made, is clearly illegal and is not enforceable.

390," Fort Lauderdale to Bangalore via Dubai. I had great expectations after learning that this was the number one airline in the world. It is far from being so, it doesn’t even qualify to be within the first 50, unfortunately. The customer service officials are so ill informed that they can hardly be of help to the customers. They have only canned answers. The travel segment referenced to in this review was understandably canceled because of the covid pandemic. So then I called up to cancel the ticket the customer service diverted me to another website and made me fill out the entire form and submit cancellation. He said it is going to take two weeks for the refund, which was fair. Emirates is misusing the disaster to its advantage and abusing the customers. Now they say it is going to take 90 days to refund the amount. Now there is no way I can get back without being refunded the amount. Their responses are very poor. An airline quality and service is better judged at the time of an exception. Emirates has failed to live up to it’s Customer expectation. Most other airlines I had booked have already refunded my money. So that gives us a relative sense or comparison."," Fort Lauderdale to Bangalore via Dubai.

The floor was sticky to walk on. As were were seated adjacent not far from the washrooms it was easy to observe the cabin crew very rarely checked the washrooms. There was an over use of the seat belt signs to ensure customers were seated rather than annoying the crew serving meals I was given the choice between beef and chicken and when I chose beef was informed there was none left but if I wanted to wait 20 minutes perhaps there maybe some left over. Sure enough 20 minutes later a beef meal arrived and was promptly dumped on the meal tray and was stone cold. The crew through the 15 hours were noticeably aggressive to all and sundry. The toilets were locked 20 minutes from landing in Dubai and my wife had to beg to use the washroom. Whilst we were informed this was the last flight out of Australia I guess the crew were coming to grips with loosing their jobs.

When travelling by Emirates it is advisable to ensure that your luggage is secure and that you do not use back packs, duffel bags or any other type of bag whereby a zip can be seperated to allow baggage handlers access to your luggage.

407," Amsterdam to Cebu via Dubai. It was my first experience flying with Emirates and without the slightest doubt will be my last. I believe that critical situations bring out the true nature of people as well as companies and it is my opinion that Emirates came out as uncaring, irresponsible and thoroughly unethical. I had a return flight from the Netherlands to the Philippines and I was supposed to fly back from Cebu to Amsterdam at the end of March, but I became stranded due to the suddenly imposed lockdown. The situation became quickly truly dreary with flights getting cancelled by the hour and airports getting closed with almost no notice. The military being deployed in Manila and checkpoints set up to allow only tourists with a ticket for a flight leaving in the next 12 hours to enter. Tourists were informed to leave the country on 20th March at the latest. My domestic flight to Cebu was cancelled on 17th March and I desperately tried to contact Emirates to make the appropriate changes but to no avail: on their website, there was only a local telephone number to which nobody ever answered. I asked friends to contact the Emirates Dutch local office on my behalf, but they ended up with the same result, nobody answered the phone or Facebook messages. On 17th March a rescue flight was organized by a local private company, I landed in Clark International and went straight to the local Emirates office. The representative simply told me that they could not do anything for me because flights were fully booked, informed me that Clark airport would also be closed in 48 hours and told me that I had to figure out a solution myself. I had to purchase an incredibly expensive new flight with another airline departing that very same evening from Manila and rush against time to make it to the airport on time (I made it just thanks to the kindness of strangers who offered me a ride in a private transfer van). In the span of the following few hours i met at least a dozen travelers who had flights with KLM and who told me that KLM (not an airline partner) had rebooked all of them on Emirates flights. To summarize, Emirates made it impossible for stranded travelers to contact the airline, declined and shirked away from all responsibilities to find a solution, offered me no assistance and no compensation whatsoever, had no qualms to give away a large number of their seats to other (non-partner) airlines, but did not offer its own customers the same courtesy.

416," London to Auckland via Dubai. I thought Emirates offered an extremely family-friendly service as I was travelling on my own with my 17-month-old son. They were extremely attentive throughout all of my flights. I thought the food was of a decent standard - they could have offered an extended drink service but if you wanted a second or a third drink you only had to ask. Some of the flights had a velcro cover for the bassinet which I did not like as my son could easily open it but the London to Dubai leg had a zip which made me feel at ease that he was safe. The flight attendants were happy to look after my son when I needed to go to the toilet and on a couple of flights, some of the attendants went the extra mile and carried my son around the plane to give me a break. They had bottled baby milk and organic baby food which was a first for me when flying with my children. On the way to New Zealand I flew to Lon-Dubai-Bali-Auckland and I preferred this to the return leg when I flew direct from Auckland to Dubai which was nearly 17 hours and I would not recommend it with a toddler. I thought the inflight entertainment was of a high standard but I could not connect to the Wifi on any of the flights. Some of the aircraft were a little tired and the seating could have done with replacing but overall I found Emirates offered a good service for a father taking his 17-month son all the way to New Zealand on his own."," London to Auckland via Dubai.

417," Singapore to Amsterdam via Dubai. While the previous flight with an Emirates A380 went OK, the connecting flight from Dubai to Amsterdam was terrible. In Dubai, the security check is at the gate, so it is not possible to bring a bottle of water with you. With this fact, Emirates does not bother to supply its passengers with an extra bottle of water during the flight but brings just one small cup of water at mealtimes. During the flight, the Emirates staff gathered at the rear pantry and were talking loud for a long time. Could not sleep with this irritating loud chatting. The toilets were not once cleaned during the 6.5-hour flight. Several toilets had a malfunction with water and some toilets had urine on the floor. Terrible! The seats were not very wide, narrow in fact, and had a hard seat. It was a claustrophobic experience. The seats have had their best years long ago. I have flown Emirates for many years and was always more or less satisfied, but the quality is going down the last two years and now at a level, I decided not to fly Emirates any more."," Singapore to Amsterdam via Dubai.

423," London Stansted to Colombo via Dubai. First flight with Emirates after several years using other airlines and I must say standards have slipped. Emirates used to be a cut above, with better food, IFE and more generous alcohol supply. Now they are very run of the mill and when you add in the inconveniences of Dubai airport compared with other options in the gulf they are solidly average. I used them because Stansted is my local airport, so their flights are convenient and because of this will probably reluctantly use the company in future. Low point of my 4 economy flights was the unsmiling, unfriendly and arguably rude crew member I had looking after my part of the cabin on the outward leg from STN. Not once in 7 hrs did I see her make eye contact or smile at anyone, including her colleagues. The other crew I encountered were generally friendly and reasonably efficient. The seats felt worn and were not as comortable as I remember, probably as the aircraft are generally ageing across their fleet. The food ranged from edible to fairly horrible, only the IFE remains outstanding. Drinks were grudgingly supplied after a couple of hours in the air and were of indifferent quality, although top ups were available if you went to the galley."," London Stansted to Colombo via Dubai.

426,"  I've flown business class (as well as premium economy) many times on long-haul flights between Asia and the US, on a pretty wide variety of airlines. For my current trip, there appeared to be a reasonably good business class fare (but not the best fare among all airline selections) to NYC via Dubai on Emirates, apparently because of a long (7+ hour) layover in Dubai. Even though it wasn't the best business class fare available among all airlines, and the layover was longer than I'd prefer, I chose Emirates based on their reputation. However, Emirates doesn't inform you when purchasing the ticket, and you don't find out until you arrive at the airport in Dubai, that this business class fare does not include any lounge access. So, you basically get a slight discount on a business class fare, but no business class lounge access during a 7+ hour layover. Also, on the Emirates 777-300ER, the business class seat does not actually lay flat (its angled quite a bit), and the leg / foot section of the seat when extended is rather flimsy. Unless you have a child-size body, it's quite difficult to get comfortable for any actual sleep on a long haul ""business class"" flight with the type of seat that Emirates installed on the 777-300ER. Based on my actual flight and in-airport experiences, I'd rank business class on other airlines much higher than Emirates business class. For long haul travel between Asia and the US, I'd even rank Philippine Airlines business class in a higher category than Emirates, particular because Philippine Airlines business class fares are typically several to many hundreds of USD cheaper than Emirates best business class fares, and you aren't subjected to any undisclosed trickery relating to business class lounge access. I'll avoid Emirates in the future, for sure - Emirates is way overpriced for what you actually get. Come to think of it, for a route between Asia and NYC through the Mideast, I'd have to say premium economy on Qatar Airlines is a much better value for the money, with a reasonably good comfort level as well as excellent service, as compared to Emirates business class.","  I've flown business class (as well as premium economy) many times on long-haul flights between Asia and the US, on a pretty wide variety of airlines.

428," Male to Dubai. We boarded our flight and proceeded to wait on the tarmac for 3.5-hours! The flight was then canceled but because we started calling customer service while on the tarmac we were 2 of 300+ people that were able to get on the next flight which then waited on the tarmac for 1 more hour making us miss our connecting flight which then made us miss our next connection. The worst part was when we got to Dubai we had a 5 hour layover until our next rebooked flight. Emirates wouldn't get us a hotel because it was less than 8 hours and they wouldn't let us in their lounge because we weren't business class. We sat at the airport 2 hrs for our flight, we sat on the tarmac for 3.5 hours, then we sat on the tarmac for 1 hour, then we sat on the flight for 4 hours and got to the airport and were told there was no compensation, no accommodations, no customer service.

429,"  Shanghai to Gatwick via Dubai. I bought an Emirates student fare one-way ticket as they promoted in China, so the value for money is relatively good. I initially just wanted to use it as an opportunity to experience A380 (my first impression of Emirates at that time) as well as avoiding more expensive one-way fare of British Airways, but it turned out that the flying experience was really more stable than  other planes I had experienced, and the touchdown on the runway was also the best experience in my lifetime. The seat was a little bit too narrow for me, so I gave only four stars. The meal was really delicious and fitted well to my taste.","  Shanghai to Gatwick via Dubai.

430,"  Brisbane to Zurich via Dubai. After hearing nothing but great things about Emirates I have been left so disappointed. Our first leg from Brisbane to Dubai started with them not giving my 7 year old daughter her meal. Not only did they forget the first meal of the 14hr flight but I had to ask them again for the second meal. Approximately 4 hours out from Dubai the oxygen masks dropped from the panels above. After 15 long minutes we were advised that they thought it is a technical issue. Passengers were then asked to fold up the oxygen masks as best we could and they were left hanging in front of us. Following this there was no in-flight entertainment or service for the remainder of the flight. No compensation was offered and staff seemed more concerned about passengers who were recording the incident. After our horrendous flight and poor service from Brisbane, I asked at Heathrow about an upgrade and was told flights to Brisbane were fully booked. This was not true as the Dubai to Brisbane leg was half empty and many people had three seats to themselves. The check in procedure at Heathrow we had to use the self service machines and this was not made clear until we had already queued for 25 minutes. There were no toilets in the lounges at Heathrow and Dubai which meant that once you had shown your passport and ticket and gone into the lounge you had to go back outside to the toilets and then queue again. Our flight from London departed at 9pm. My daughter didn’t end up getting her meal until 11.50pm. It took them 2.5hrs to commence the meal service. The flight from Dubai to Brisbane was no better. My 7 year old needed to go to the toilet as soon as we got on the plane and the toilet hadn’t been cleaned. My 7 year old fell asleep on take off so I asked if her meal could be kept for later when she woke up. I was told this was not a problem however when I asked for it 7 hours later I was told we she couldn’t have as they couldn’t reheat it. I then had to ask if I could at least get the other food that didn’t require being reheated. The customer service on three of the four flights was absolutely appalling. The flight attendants were not pleasant and friendly.  On one flight I pressed the buzzer for some water due to my daughter being asleep on me and no-one attended at all – the plane landed 1.5 hours after I pressed the buzzer and we disembarked. I could not get over the amount of time the seat belt signs came on when there was barely any turbulence. On top of this, the excessive amount of time they kept the seatbelt sign on when there was no turbulence was ridiculous. At one point it had been on for over one hour and my daughter needed the toilet. We got up to go to the toilet and I was told I would be going at our own risk.  It felt to me that they kept the seat belt sign on for an extended period so the crew got out of doing work. I have travelled extensively for the past 20 years and Emirates is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Do not waste your money. I will never fly with them again.","  Brisbane to Zurich via Dubai. After hearing nothing but great things about Emirates I have been left so disappointed.

During check in when I asked to provide a seat near to my family members (traveling on the same route, but different PNR), the check in agent did not replied anything, but issue the boarding pass with the seat which was randomly assigned 48 hrs prior to the departure. However, the DXB-JFK flight was almost empty, so I can sit with my other family members. Food quality as well as quantity was tremendously poor. They served one meal just after taking off from DXB and another meal just before arrival in JFK. No other meal in between for this almost 15 hrs journey except a biscuit size pizza slice.  I pre ordered hindu non veg meal. During food service, I informed the cabin crews about my change of seat, but one crew served me a packet saying Hindu non-veg meal which was not hindu meal. My all other family members got different foods in their hindu meal.  The most confusing in the  journey was Emirates hotel policy. I booked a ticket from Emirates website with fare basis economy saver and 13 hrs stop over in Dubai having no shorter connection. My family members purchased same economy save ticket with almost same fare but from agents and they got Dubai Connect voucher. I suggest Emirates to provide the hotel eligibility during the booking process. Probably, I would not book via Emirates website then. The only good thing in the journey was availability of wheel chair in all airport.","  Kolkata to New York JFK via Dubai. I am totally disappointed with their service.

I pre ordered hindu non veg meal. During food service, I informed the cabin crews about my change of seat, but one crew served me a packet saying Hindu non-veg meal which was not hindu meal. My all other family members got different foods in their hindu meal.  The most confusing in the  journey was Emirates hotel policy. I booked a ticket from Emirates website with fare basis economy saver and 13 hrs stop over in Dubai having no shorter connection. My family members purchased same economy save ticket with almost same fare but from agents and they got Dubai Connect voucher. I suggest Emirates to provide the hotel eligibility during the booking process. Probably, I would not book via Emirates website then. The only good thing in the journey was availability of wheel chair in all airport.","[('Kolkata', 'n'), ('New', 'n'), ('York', 'n'), ('JFK', 'n'), ('via', None), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('.', None), ('totally', 'r'), ('disappointed', 'a'), ('service', 'n'), ('.', None), ('check', 'n'), ('asked', 'v'), ('provide', 'v'), ('seat', 'n'), ('near', None), ('family', 'n'), ('members', 'n'), ('(', None), ('traveling', 'v'), ('route', 'n'), (',', None), ('different', 'a'), ('PNR', 'n'), (')', None), (',', None), ('check', 'n'), ('agent', 'n'), ('replied', 'v'), ('anything', 'n'), (',', None), ('issue', 'v'), ('boarding', 'v'), ('pass', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), ('randomly', 'r'), ('assigned', 'v'), ('48', None), ('hrs', 'a'), ('prior', 'r'), ('departure', 'n'), ('.', None), ('However', 'r'), (',', None), ('DXB-JFK', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('almost', 'r'), ('empty', 'a'), (',', None), ('sit', 'v'), ('family', 'n'), ('members', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Food', 'n'), ('quality', 'n'), ('well', 'r'), ('quantity', 'n'), ('tremendously', 'r'), ('poor', 'a'), ('.', None), ('served', 'v'), ('one', None), ('meal', 'n'), ('taking', 'v'), ('DXB', 'n'), ('another', None), ('meal', 'n'), ('arrival', 'a'), ('JFK', 'n'), ('.', None), ('meal', 'n'), ('almost', 'r'), ('15', None), ('hrs', 'a'), ('journey', 'n'), ('except', None), ('biscuit', 'n'), ('size', 'n'), ('pizza', 'n'), ('slice', 'n'), ('.', None), ('pre', 'v'), ('ordered', 'a'), ('hindu', 'n'), ('non', 'n'), ('veg', 'n'), ('meal', 'n'), ('.', None), ('food', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), (',', None), ('informed', 'v'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('crews', 'v'), ('change', 'n'), ('seat', 'n'), (',', None), ('one', None), ('crew', 'n'), ('served', 'v'), ('packet', 'n'), ('saying', 'v'), ('Hindu', 'n'), ('non-veg', 'a'), ('meal', 'n'), ('hindu', 'a'), ('meal', 'n'), ('.', None), ('family', 'n'), ('members', 'n'), ('got', 'v'), ('different', 'a'), ('foods', 'n'), ('hindu', 'n'), ('meal', 'n'), ('.', None), ('confusing', 'a'), ('journey', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('hotel', 'n'), ('policy', 'n'), ('.', None), ('booked', 'v'), ('ticket', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('website', 'v'), ('fare', 'a'), ('basis', 'n'), ('economy', 'n'), ('saver', 'n'), ('13', None), ('hrs', 'n'), ('stop', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('shorter', 'a'), ('connection', 'n'), ('.', None), ('family', 'n'), ('members', 'n'), ('purchased', 'v'), ('economy', 'n'), ('save', 'v'), ('ticket', 'n'), ('almost', 'r'), ('fare', 'n'), ('agents', 'n'), ('got', 'v'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('Connect', 'n'), ('voucher', 'n'), ('.', None), ('suggest', 'v'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('provide', 'v'), ('hotel', 'n'), ('eligibility', 'n'), ('booking', 'n'), ('process', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Probably', 'r'), (',', None), ('would', None), ('book', 'n'), ('via', None), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('website', 'v'), ('.', None), ('good', 'a'), ('thing', 'n'), ('journey', 'n'), ('availability', 'n'), ('wheel', 'n'), ('chair', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('.', None)]","  Kolkata New York JFK via Dubai . totally disappointed service . check ask provide seat near family member ( travel route , different PNR ) , check agent reply anything , issue board pas seat randomly assign 48 hrs prior departure .

435," Customer service and good hospitality has gone out of the window for this money grabbing airline. Emirates airline failed to provide a refund for a ticket I paid for my 87 year old grandad who refused to fly on a 13 hour delayed flight. On the 13 hour delayed flight they looked after us in the UK but on the delayed 12 hour stay in Dubai they didn’t even offer us a bottle of water at the airport and then sent us to a terminal with no baby changing facilities or services for a 6 hours. I paid for a sub standard lounge myself out of necessity for my family but Emirates refused any hospitality or compensation. Inflight food was horrible. On the return journey the scones, clotted cream and jam was acceptable but the rest of the 6 meals we had on the other 3 flights were horrible. Emirates beef and mash - meat was too large and overcooked to be edible, sauce saltier than sea water and a salad of sweetcorn. Emirates directly employed staff are great but third party ground handling staff are horrible. No customer service skills at all shown in Mumbai. They didn’t even offer a buggy for my child in a massive airport and then went on to charge me an extortionate amount for 17kg excess baggage. No hospitality in Dubai, forget a lounge, no information communication or water when delayed with a family. Their profit grabbing has lead to a simple burger and fries meal costing £20 for 1 person and a sub standard lounge at £180 at my expense! By far the worst airline from the airlines I have been on: Etihad, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, South African airlines, Air India, Turkish Airlines, Indigo, BA and Cathay. Contact customer service and receive nothing citing rules where they can basically extortion money from trapped passengers. Ridiculous, never ever again."," Customer service and good hospitality has gone out of the window for this money grabbing airline.

The Emirates Business Class lounge at Dubai airport, although huge, is dated and so big that it becomes inconvenient.  Huge, but so convenient to navigate so one has to keep walking, hoping to find anything. The food was average. The service was courteous. The flight was not even 3 hours but what really made it an unpleasant experience was the attitude of the air hostess serving my side. The welcome on board was anything but warm. I thought, maybe they are busy and it will get better. I am short and had a heavy backpack and a duty-free shopping bag in my hand. I was struggling to open the overhead bin but she did not offer to help me or open the bin for me. On the contrary, when I asked where to put it she just gestured and ignored that I was in a pickle. Thankfully, a fellow passenger got up to help me. The air hostess's attitude continued for the rest of the flight - once she was passing by and I stopped her for a glass of water and she almost did an eye roll when she stopped. I did not pay extra for this. Honestly, my experience with Emirates Economy when going to Dubai was better than this. The biggest turn off is a staff with an attitude. Fine, they probably do not like the Dubai to Pakistan sector but that is not my fault. We pay a good amount and honestly, it does not take much to be nice and courteous. So disappointed, especially when I thought Emirates business class would be the best experience. The 2-3-2 configuration is poor, the wifi never worked,.

440,"  We had a flight from Tehran to Auckland via Dubai in January 2020. Due to the Ukrainian flight crash, our flight was rescheduled twice by Emirates, which means we had to have 20.5 hr of stop in Dubai. We called the airline office in Tehran to see our options of accommodation in Dubai. They said yes due to a stop longer than 13 hrs the airline must provide accommodation for you but they didn’t have access to the hotel booking system and asked us to address this issue in emirates airline counter in Dubai airport. We arrived in Dubai and asked about the hotel booking option. Surprisingly they said we cannot have any accommodation provided by airline, and it is not their problem! We had arguments about the airline policy and they were refusing to show us the policy and just giving us some wrong information that it is in their policy and they cannot provide accommodation. After 2 hrs of discussion and argument, they finally provided a twin room for three people. We were really disappointed. I had a surgery on my neck about two weeks before the flight which and had to ask the cabin crew to open the head locker for me. I asked one of the crews for the first time, he opened the head locker for me and said “don’t ask me again to do that for you, I’ve got back pain!”.

447,"  New York to Perth via Dubai. Our outbound was delayed from Newark and I was concerned on our entire flight that we would miss our connection in Dubai. The host assured me Emirates had the ability to hold any flight for up to one hour, and that we would make our connection. We arrived only to find we had missed our connection by 20 minutes. We were devastated, as this was the only flight out that day, and were told we would have to spend 24 hours in Dubai. There was no one on the ground to help us, so we made our own way to customer service. The staff were rude and completely unapologetic that we would lose 24hrs from our vacation. They told us to go to the hotel and didn't give us any guidance as to how to get our baggage, or even where our baggage would end up. The flight they rebooked us on allocated us seats at the back of the plane, as if losing 24hrs wasn't punishment enough. We then spent a further 3 hours at the airport, trying to get our seats moved and also secure our baggage. Even more concerning than all of this, there was no guidance around what it meant to enter the UAE and what we should be careful of medication-wise. When we went through customs to enter Dubai, they searched my bag and started questioning myself and my husband for sleep medication I had with me. It was incredibly disturbing and made even worse later finding out my husband had both Benedryl and pseudoephedrine - two over the counter drugs that are jailable offences in the UAE without a prescription! This is a complete lack of duty of care by Emirates.  This is disgusting behavior and not what I expect of what is said to be a premium airline. The above, and the complete lack of empathy I received from Emirates staff has been a completely awful experience. Emirates should be ashamed you are charging the fees you charge for this type of treatment.","  New York to Perth via Dubai.

One criticism – which was shared by other passengers and indeed cabin crew we spoke to – is the appalling choice of music played when boarding the aircraft.

450,"  Singapore to New York via Dubai. For this trip to JFK we decided to travel 1st time with emirates. On the departure date the journey was more than 21 hours from Singapore. The staff in the plane were arrogant and unhelpful. They were unwilling to help even for taking hot water for my other baby to make milk. Imagine requesting for hot water for baby milk (1st time on to the flight) and was greeted with an unhappy face from the crew. This is not during the period where everyone were required to remain seated. We are family of 8. Our baby 24 mths old and 4 mths old were not making things easy. The staff was rude to us from the start.  We were not demanding passenger nor were we rude at any time. We had on many occasions called them by pressing the button but at all times nobody came to our seat to attend to us. This is far from what we called excellent service coming from an international airline.  They told us to put up the hand carry luggage ourselves when my 13 yr old daughter had difficulties on 1 occasion. On another occasion there were clean pair of socks on the floor and they told us to clean that up. I was appalled by the choice of words they used. They even make unhappy faces when we requested for drinks as kids were thirsty. I am not a big eater but even i find that the food provided was insufficient in portion. We should have been served a proper meal for the last meal but instead we were given a small piece of pizza. As we were all very hungry on that day and Halal food was difficult to find at JFK airport we had to travel very far to have our meal at Philadelphia, the only place we know there were authentic halal food. This is from my experience. I was never required to send a feedback on service by an airline but our experience on 24 Dec with Emirates has left us so disappointed that we have no choice but to write this review.","  Singapore to New York via Dubai.

I first rang the emirates number in Singapore and spoke to an individual who told me they would email about the case. No email arrived. A week later I was passing through the airport again and went to the Emirates desk. The member of staff was incredibly rude, and informed me it was nothing she could help with (in fact she just sat shaking her head for most of the conversation). I then rang the Singapore number again and the member of staff informed me I would have to complain. I explained that I did not want to complain, but was just looking to have a normal conversation with a member of staff. The cost of the replacement clothes was modest. Anyway, I then used the feedback form online to send my request, and received nothing back after 3 days. Emirates do not provide an email address. My next step was to speak with someone on online chat function, who informed me it could take up to 30 days to respond to my complaint. I expressed incredulity at this number. My only conclusion is that Emirates does not do customer service - unless that is, you want to buy a business class ticket. It has been a very frustrating and sorry affair. The lack of clear information, mixed messages, is very frustrating. Individual members of staff seem to have no authority to deal with a problem, which speaks to a dysfunctional and frustrating work environment.","  Stansted to Singapore via Dubai.

The aircraft was well-decorated and the legroom was satisfying. nThey have the best inflight entertainment system. The tickets were relatively cheap. The cabin crew were generally friendly.

456,"  Barcelona to Mexico City. I boarded Emirates flight EK255 at Barcelona airport. We were assigned D19 gate, once the boarding started they made us go down a spiral staircase to the exterior, to wait for a bus to arrive after fifteen minutes to a far away location from to board by steps.  The unacceptable fact is that once the passengers got off the bus, soaking under the storm, the crew hindered the traffic, stopping the passengers outside the airplane access door to check their documents before allowing entry, despite having credited our access at the boarding gate and when boarding the bus. It is ridiculous that security measures are so poorly coordinated that they need to check the boarding passes three times. After twenty minutes under the rain, I managed to enter the plane. Before occupying my seat seat -7K- right next to the door, a second flight attendant asked me for my boarding pass, preventing me from sitting until I showed it. It was a pleasant experience to arrive in Spain by Aeromexico, while leaving with Emirates has been a terrible disappointment.","  Barcelona to Mexico City.

457,"  Johannesburg to San Francisco via Dubai. I traveled to San Francisco  for important business meetings. After experiencing almost 4 hours of delays I was informed on my arrival (12 Jan. 2020) in SF, Emirates informed me that my baggage had been lost. I was asked to complete a form and was told that the bag would be delivered to my hotel the next day. This was already upsetting because I didn't have clean clothes and would be attending my first meeting the following morning. I was forced to buy a clean set of clothes. After being told that Emirates would be in contact with me, and having heard nothing from the company I decided to call them later that day, only to find out that my baggage would only arrive the next day (14 Jan. 2020). As upsetting as this was, I didn't want to spend more money to rectify their mistake, so I borrowed a set of clothes from my colleague for our meetings the following day. Once again, not hearing anything from Emirates, I called them the morning of the 14th to ensure that everything will be taken care of. However, when I returned to my hotel later the afternoon my bag still was not delivered. Once again, I called Emirates just to hear that there was not anything they could do to resolve my issue, I was simply asked to wait. Now I will have to spend more money fixing their mistake. The lack service, communication and professionalism I received from Emirates has been distasteful. There has been no effort from their side to rectify their mistake, which is appalling for a company who consider themselves a leader in business travel. For this reason, I believe one should rather avoid using their services if you are time-pressed and have important meetings to attend.","  Johannesburg to San Francisco via Dubai.

Please take note of it and give the meals to me to this new seat. After a second another crew came to me and begging at me said she wrongly delivered the food to the couple and accept her apologies. Still, I was keeping my calm. Later on, they offered me a bun which contains eggs. I've highlighted to the crew that Hindhu vegetarian meals doesn't contain beef and eggs. Why didn't check my request before distributing the foods. The crew came again and said  sorry.  Now same 2nd incident happened while from UK to Dubai on 31/12/19 on EK008.

480,"  New York to Kolkata via Dubai. We were able to get adjacent seats in bulkhead, giving us a good bit of leg space and being at the edge in the centre section of a 3x4x3 layout, the flight to Dubai left us feeling less cramped. The plane was organized in a way that offered spaces to stand and stretch and the bathrooms on the flight to Dubai were tidy. We were served ample meals and liquor was provided on request. Snacks were laid out in the galley. The collection of films to view was huge -- in fact, selecting from this immense library was a challenge. Good head sets were provided. Flight attendants were friendly and I thought their uniforms were attractive. The wait at Dubai to connect to Calcutta was several hours but the airport is a shopper's paradise. I found the prices on liquor competitive and there were many international shops and eateries. The terminals were clean  with ample seating. The security check between flights was smooth. At JFK on boarding, a camera snapped our picture; the boarding passes themselves were not scanned. We had economy class tickets but on boarding at Dubai, we found a cabin crew member selling empty seats in business class. He had a mobile credit card reader. We paid for two tickets. The business class was in a 2x3x2 layout and was uncrowded.  The cabin felt old fashioned and the seats did not go to 180 degrees; it was angled, but comfortable nevertheless. Attendants were  very pleasant. Duty free shopping was available and I picked up a a few cosmetics. No landing cards were provided. Neither were any amenity kits, though a pair of socks and a eye shade in a plastic wrapper was in the magazine pocket. The TV screens were on the wall separating the biz class cabin from first class. All the flights were on schedule. Emirates does not belong to any of the big 3 alliances. The only US airline you can get points with is Jet Blue. My first time with Emirates left a positive impression. If they were members of one of the alliances, I would fly with them again.","  New York to Kolkata via Dubai.

484,"  Trivandrum to New York via Dubai. I have been a regular customer on Emirates Airlines for the last 5 years and chose this airline over many others because of the great service in the past. However, in my most recent travels, I have experienced poor management of flight connections in Dubai Airport. Due to this, I have missed several flights to New York, have been stranded in Dubai for days, have lost or missed my baggage, or have had to run at top speed to barely make it to my gate on time. There is technically only a tight 1 hour and 15-minute layover in Dubai but lately, the flight from TRV to Dubai has been arriving 30-45 minutes late due to an inability to get a gate. This of course suggests poor planning and organizing on your airline’s behalf. This delay leaves about 20 minutes for us to deboard the plane, figure out our new gate, clear security (twice), and arrive at our departing flight. It is almost impossible to do this especially for customers who are first time travelers, older, disabled, or impaired. As an asthmatic, the marathon run I had to make from Terminal C to Terminal A led to bad wheezing and could have resulted in a medical emergency if I had not carried my inhaler. Several times, we only barely made our Dubai to JFK flight because we paid for preferred seats in the front of the plane allowing us to leave quickly. Despite experiencing this incredibly stressful connection, Emirates staff provides no support to help us off the flight quickly. In fact, on our December 12th flight when we alerted the flight attended about our very tight connection (EK201 was already boarding when we landed), she dismissively told us “everyone has a connection flight not just you”. She also argued with my father and I for 5 minutes further delaying our exit from the plane. This is poor management and could be remedied by announcing the names of passengers with very tight connections. However, it seems Emirates no longer cares about their customers. Due to our marathon run, we did make our flight on December 12th, but my relief was short-lived. We were informed that all 3 of our checked bags were not loaded and would instead arrive on EK203 on December 13th at 8:00 am. On December 13th, I called the Emirates number for baggage services at 9am and was told my bags had arrived and JFK and needed to clear customs before it was delivered to my home. I was also informed that I would be updated on my baggage status- which did not occur. My family and I were put through hell to get our baggage back. We had to contact Emirates 5-7 times within the day. At one point, a chat service agent gave us conflicting information insisting that our baggage was still in Dubai despite being told otherwise many times. Ultimately after and exhausting flight and while still jetlagged we had to stay up until 2:30 am calling both Emirates and the delivery company (Bex) every hour till our bags were delivered. Due to the issues detailed above, my family and I have decided to no longer fly Emirates. . I used to be a loyal customer, but your company has really gone down the drain these past few flights and loyalty is not a good enough reason to suffer during my travels. Horrible Service.

487,"  I've been travelling Emirates for over a decade for work, am a Skywards customer, and have previously always been impressed with the quality of the services on board. However, in the last few years I've seen a decline in the food quality and lounge facilities, as access has grown dramatically. All this is fine, except for a recent incident which has convinced me it's time to switch to another airline for our long haul flights. This past year I was denied boarding on a Dubai-Kolkata leg of a flight while I was enroute to a wedding.  I requested not to be the ""random"" selection for denied boarding (due to overbooking). I was told as compensation I would be given a return ticket from Dubai to Calcutta, but I explained this had no value to me as someone who lives in Canada and is not based in Dubai. The Agent then  informed me that he had made a note on the file and upon ticketing it could be changed to a ticket from Dubai-Toronto upon calling in. I confirmed verbally with the agent 3 times. It was 2 am, and I retreated to get some sleep. Naturally when I went to use the ticket, I was informed this was not possible. However the Emirates ticketing agents informed me that the ticket could be used to fly from Dubai to Middle East destinations such as Syria, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan and then chuckled. I have spent multiple hours on the phone with Emirates agents trying to sort out the problem, and the service has ranged from excellent and understanding (thank you Connor in Manchester), to rude and gleeful at pulling a bit of a hoax on a customer. Ultimately Emirates refused to honour the guarantees made by the agent (in spite of conducting an investigation which did not result in findings that contradicted my statements), because their agent was a DNATA representative. In short, you cannot trust the folks standing under the Emirates sign at the check-in in Dubai, because Emirates itself will not back their guarantees. I am extremely disappointed, and have started flying Qatar Airways instead.

The Boarding gate where we were to board had several leaks so we had to try and huddle in the dry sections. There was not enough seating. Boarding was chaotic at best and anyone willing to lie about their Emirates membership got in first. The lady at the door was unable to cope. The cabin was dirty, the crew seemed to not know each other, 2 rows at the back in Economy were kept empty for the use of crew (at the cost of paying passengers and despite having a section for crew to rest and sleep) which despite my request they refused to relinquish. Rest of the passengers had to make do without the 6 extra seats. Apparently this is a regular reservation for the crew on this flight. I paid 350 Dirhams for a horrible seat with legroom only for my right leg. Photo attached. Crew shouted to each other about running out of meals, one crew member scolded the other members and paid very little attention to the general public. There was one apparently senior staff who did a royal walk through the cabin and only spoke to 3 or 4 people whom she chose, I am guessing at random. Lastly they took away blankets an hour before landing and then piled them into bags. So again customer was last. It was cold and we were still an hour away. All in all I would not recommend Emirates to anyone. Please avoid this airline until they improve and take their customers seriously. I have traveled by Emirates Business class in the past and the service was excellent.","  EK 318 from Dubai to Tokyo, Narita on 21st Nov 2019. This flight seemed to have issues right from the start.

494,  Very disappointed with this airline. The service is very poor and some cabin crew can appear disinterested. I previously used Ethiopian Airlines which has excellent service levels and was expecting similar service and better from Emirates and was sorely disappointed. The fleet used in intra-Africa flights (between Lusaka and Dubai in my case) have tiny seats and I was squashed and worried for my safety as I was in a row of three with a very large guy in the middle and I couldn't rest comfortably and was worried about getting injured. I'm used to old fleets used for intra-africa flights but Emirate seats are the smallest I've experienced. It was the worst flight ever. The cabin crew can miss rows when serving meals or drinks and it's just an annoying service. Although my flight from Dubai to London was on a new fleet with comfortable chairs what didn't change was cabin crew service which was still poor. The food is also average. I expected so much and had high hopes and was very disappointed. All style with no substance.

496," Glasgow to Dubai. My husband and I use Emirates twice a year to fly to Dubai because it’s direct with good times and have done for many years. Sadly we have found that the last few trips the service is lacking. Yes you are greeted on arrival but that is as far as the service goes. From getting a hot towel and nuts before take off to getting a menu and scowl. On this return trip after the meal was served the drinks trolley was coming up the aisle, then the stewardess stopped three rows ahead of us and wheeled past and never returned. I do feel that rather than standing gossiping with each other in the galley the stewards/stewardesses should be going round their section making sure their passengers are ok and not waiting to be summoned. The food is really not as good now either. Always curry, which is fine now and again but not all the time. The coffee is weak and horrible too. Lots of corners being cut but prices going up. Also the rewards scheme is a joke as we will never have enough to save to make proper use of them. As I mentioned the only reason we like using this airline is the good flight times and they are direct but we are considering flying with BA in future."," Glasgow to Dubai.

I show her the confirmation in my phone from their app confirming that I am checked in and for whatever reason she cannot seem to find me in their system.

So I pleaded with the woman to tell me what I needed to do to get checked in and she told me that the only way to check in is to do it through their app. I asked if I could speak to a manager or call Emirates, and the rep tells me that there is no time because the plane is about to take off. So even though I arrived in time for my flight, I was now late for my flight, and I was unable to board. I call Emirates and I was informed that I would have to purchase new tickets  or just pay a no show fee which is $400 per person plus additional fees. Which came out to $850 per person. Which actually added up to just purchasing new tickets. The thing is I not only had more than one hotel booked but I also had a connecting flight that I would also inevitably miss a well as other arrangements so I lost time, money, and had to spend more money to purchase two new tickets, also two more plane tickets when i reached Athens to finish my travel. At this point I'm infuriated and disgusted because I do not live by Newark airport, I live 1hr and 20 mins away, so not only did I miss my flights including a whole nights stay at some of my hotels, and my flight from Athens, I was stranded at this airport.

507," Sydney to Rome via Dubai. The services on the flight were beyond disappointing. I was recommended Emirates by friends and colleagues, as the best business class from Sydney to Europe. I was beyond disappointed when returning. Having flown to Europe business class for work and leisure with Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Etihad, and having flown business class to other locations on Hawaiian and Latam, I was very surprised to be so dissatisfied with the service and quality I received from Emirates, having been recommended by many colleagues and friends. I was disappointed to discover that the 14-hour flight from Dubai to Sydney did not have a lie flat bed (nor did Rome to Dubai, however, this was only 5 hours). More importantly, the service was appalling. My salad was rotting (attached photo) and my entrée was still frozen (attached photo). My TV repeatedly broke down during the flight (attached photo). The flight was largely full, so we could not be moved to another two seats seated close to one another. After raising this and the other issues with the crew, she became quite rude. Beyond our experience on the flight, upon boarding the flight at Dubai we were delayed as a result of the poor organisation at the airport for the duty-free items we had purchased in Rome. We had to provide these to be boxed and sealed, which was not the issue. The person who was doing this task, kept our boarding passes for the purposes of printing the tags to put on the boxes. However, we saw people who arrived after us, receive their boarding passes and board the flight before us, notwithstanding repeatedly asking for the gentleman to return our boarding passes to us so that we could board. Eventually, we were able to board, but only after first and business class had boarded and about half of the economy cabin. Finally, we did not receive any form of confirmation regarding our chauffeur from Sydney Airport to our home address, adding further to our stress as we were required to chase this to make sure it had been arranged. Having flown business class with various carriers, I was not impressed at all by the return flight to Sydney on Emirates in comparison. Business is not just about extra space, but about the extra service. The extra space was far from what is equivalently offered by other airlines, given the absence of a lie flatbed. Adding to that the poor service, I did not receive the benefits expected of business class, but instead economy. Since then, I have tried to liaise with Emirates to resolve the issue. After an offer of points which wouldn't even be enough for a single short-haul domestic flight, they informed me that they had made their 'final offer' and closed off correspondence. I would strongly recommend flying anything other than Emirates. Their service is terrible, before, during and after the flight and falls short of what is comparably offered."," Sydney to Rome via Dubai. The services on the flight were beyond disappointing.

520,"  Melbourne to Amsterdam via Dubai. Disappointed with the experience in general. I have flown with Emirates since the last 15 years & was easy to see how the service has gone downhill. The cabin crew (with an exception of a few) didn't seem interested in their job, no sign of any courtesy what so ever. I felt as if they are doing us a favour letting us fly on their airline, sorry but we paid for our seats, it wasn't a free ride.  On a specific incident, during food service from Dubai to Amsterdam, noticed that the cabin crew ran out of lunch options from the two sets ahead of me, which is understandable. However the cabin crew still kept asking the following passengers including myself what would we like to have only to bluntly respond back that they have run out of options. Just couldn’t understand why was she asking what we passengers would like to have when she did not have any option in the first place? This was repeated over and over again finally asking the two passengers next to me. When I questioned her about this, she had no answer, soon after I could clearly see her behaviour towards me was immediately inhospitable, she even walked passed me without asking if I needed to have a tea or coffee. I didn’t care about the tea or coffee, but guess what it did leave me with a bad taste for the airline, besides I do get to have the last say by inputting a poor score on the infotainment screen at the end of the flight, which I did. Cabin crew of airlines thank or greet their passengers while disembarking, however noticed that some of the cabin crew in Emirates didn’t seem to bother. On a positive note, the ground staff are great & at least courteous, something that is missing once you get on flight. Emirates seriously need to re-train cabin crew to at least put on a pleasant look on their face, let alone a smile, most of the crew look grumpy & unhappy with the job they are doing.","  Melbourne to Amsterdam via Dubai.

522," Frankfurt to Singapore via Dubai. Avoid this airline at all cost. I was at Frankfurt airport trying to catch my flight to Singapore. At the gate, the ground staff were threatening to pull me off the flight if I don't comply with their 7-kg cabin luggage limit. I am totally fine with this as it has been enforced by many airlines. However, I have never come across such rude and hostile ground staff who have nothing to say but threats. They tried to play police and treat their customers like criminals. Customer service is simply non-existent. They rushed me to clear my bag or they were going to take me off the flight. Their hostile words were uncalled for and they kept telling me the gate was going to close, as if they were so hard-up on my money since every extra kg is 39 euro. I didn't want to argue with them as I know it was not the resolution. In the end, I paid over 100 euro as I wouldn't want to speak any further with them, and just wanted to get home.

527," Had a disastrous experience with Emirates recently. I was supposed to fly from New Dehli to Dubai on a direct flight taking off at 9:50 pm. When we just arrived at the airport with my colleague we learned already that the flight would be delayed and ETA planned at 00:00. Just 15 min before the planned new departure, still no news. I had to go and try to get some info to be informed by chance that the flight has to land in Lucknow - 40 min away from Dehli for weather conditions. But a few more minutes to refuel and the flight would bridge at Dehli. Planned new departure: 1:40am. We then learned around 1:20 am that the flight would be delayed until 7:30 PM.with no further explanations. The whole crowd started to get mad, complaining vocally to the staff who had no explanation to give. I learned by chance again afterwards that the flying staff was on too many extra hours and had to rest before re-flying. Emirates did not anticipate this obvious issue that made the flight to Dubai impossible for a long time. After more than 1 hour of complaining and shouting, and no answers from the staff, a passenger took the lead and had to inform everyone that anyway our only solution would be to collect back our luggage and try to find an alternative flight if any. I decided to call Emirates who booked me on the 11 am flight as the 4:14 am flights with all the mess around would not be catchable for any of us despite the fact that 26 seats were still available due to the boarding pass issue. It took us another hour to go through the passport control back in a chaotic situation and finally get our luggage back. Emirates claimed that they would offer us a hotel and breakfast. But getting out of the airport we discovered that the 360 passengers we waiting on a parking lot for buses to come to drive us 40 min away from the airport. It would take 2 hours to get our room and it was already 4:30 am. We decided to avoid the mess and stay at the airport with no sleep and not even a single bottle of water given by Emirates. At 7 am when we checked in again and complained about our dreadful experience, the staff claimed that it was well managed, Emirates offering us a hotel room and a breakfast. It drove me mad and I asked to talk to the most Senior Emirates staff member at the airport. I could not talk to him as he was busy in a meeting, not even considering the fair complaint of an angry customer. He just did not care! I am flying 100 days a year for the last 15 years and it is the most painful experience I had so far. Not only the situation was tough but the staff was totally incapable to inform us of anything, letting us wait for hours for nothing and only the buzz around informed us.

528,"  Birmingham to Delhi via Dubai. The quality of Emirates has plummeted. From poor movie and entertainment choices, to screens not working, it was disappointing. The chair directly in front of me had a broken mechanism so it kept lurching backwards throughout the flight - even during take off. What is by far the worst for me (and has been discussed by friends who have recently flown economy Emirates) is the lack of drinks. They seem to have removed the bar service, except the limited drinks served with meals. So, I calculated we spent 5 hours without drink when you calculate our 2 hour stop over (where we were battling previous delay so no time got airport drinks), to be sitting in an aircraft got almost 2 hours before drinks became available. It was uncomfortable and poor service. Eventually I went to find the drinks myself - and was offered the standard small sealed cup! Shocking to think such inconsiderate service is part of Emirates - made more irritating by the signs on the screen asking passengers to keep hydrated during flights by drinking water. One very poor hot meal and the first and most awful 2 finger sandwich offered on a 7.6 hour flight - awful. And the WiFi was non existent - another reason we normally book with Emirates. I would rather fly any other flight than travel with emirates now. A rather traumatic experience.","  Birmingham to Delhi via Dubai. The quality of Emirates has plummeted.

537,  Barcelona to Sydney via Dubai. We found the flight attendants rude. When we were arriving in Sydney people were going to the kitchenette and collecting the arrival cards but when my husband asked for one he was told that they would be distributed soon. The cards were distributed on the other side of the cabin. We did not get a card when we asked the flight attendant we were told we don't need it now in Sydney. When we asked why the other side of the cabin got embarkation cards he then said they ran short of cards and only had the cards in Arabic Language. We then asked him why he did not say in the first place that they ran short of cards in English. He was plain rude. We were at the rear of the plane and they just did not care.

545,"  Denpasar to Auckland. Very disappointing experience. I treated myself to a First Class frequent flyer ticket. I have flown Emirates First before which was similarly uninspiring - this flight confirmed for me to never bother again. Of course it was spacious and comfortable, couldn’t have been more so. The departure time of 5pm meant it was an ideal time to really enjoy a meal. There were only 6 passengers in First - me, another man and a family of 4 (including 2 young girls). So the cabin staff were hardly busy. After take off I did not see any uniformed flight attendants again, just a women in the serving ‘uniform’ who took food and drinks orders and served meals. She was incredibly surly and often just plain rude. For example, I when I asked for a simple champagne cocktail from the menu she rudely told me that it would take at least 15 minutes to make. Knowing that it only consisted of 2 ingredients I wasn’t deterred as she might’ve thought I’d be. The meal courses were roughly put down and she went through the motions of begrudgingly serving me. It occurred to me that maybe she was in a bad mood because all he colleagues had gone off to rest leaving her to do all the work. It was a very unpleasant experience for me. Not a single smile or kind, gentle word the whole flight.","  Denpasar to Auckland. Very disappointing experience. I treated myself to a First Class frequent flyer ticket.

554,"  Newcastle to Dubai. Having taken this flight for almost 4 years now, I have to display my displeasure over this most recent journey. Despite the flight leaving UK around lunchtime, the crew took the decision to turn down all the lights as soon as possible to pretend this was a night-time journey. What made the whole trip even more unbelievable, was the same exact thing occurred on the return journey even though departure from Dubai was 7:30am. I appreciate that Emirates used to pride themselves upon the free bar service for many years now, but to try and either save money by hoping people won't bother the flight staff if the plane is in darkness or the crews just decided to try for a quiet flight for themselves I don't really know. Being an elderly traveler (going to visit my son) I felt very uncomfortable trying to navigate my way to the bathrooms with very limited lighting. Passenger comfort and safety should always come before crew's desire for a quiet trip surely? Gone are the days where the crew would be traversing the plane regularly with drinks before, during and after the meal. I used to enjoy the spectacle, not that I took any alcohol anytime, it just seemed to break the journey down and make time pass faster. My son has submitted a complaint on Emirates website for me and has been sent only the standard ""We are looking into this"" email after almost 2 months now, so I assume they are not really interested in my comments - again, being a regular traveler on this route.","  Newcastle to Dubai. Having taken this flight for almost 4 years now, I have to display my displeasure over this most recent journey. Despite the flight leaving UK around lunchtime, the crew took the decision to turn down all the lights as soon as possible to pretend this was a night-time journey. What made the whole trip even more unbelievable, was the same exact thing occurred on the return journey even though departure from Dubai was 7:30am. I appreciate that Emirates used to pride themselves upon the free bar service for many years now, but to try and either save money by hoping people won't bother the flight staff if the plane is in darkness or the crews just decided to try for a quiet flight for themselves I don't really know. Being an elderly traveler (going to visit my son) I felt very uncomfortable trying to navigate my way to the bathrooms with very limited lighting. Passenger comfort and safety should always come before crew's desire for a quiet trip surely?

556," BKK/HKG/BKK - In ten years of flying with Emirates business class on the short Bangkok to Hong Kong route I have rarely had anything other than an excellent flight. I just love the A380 aircraft and Emirates business class layout with the bar at the back. The decor is a bit plastic for my taste, but I take the airline for its unbeatable fares, its fantastic lounges with a quite amazing food and beverage selection, its on board service, the supreme comfort of the seating, the massive IFE selection and large screens. With first class dropped from this flight, the front of the upper deck now seats around 100 economy passengers. Yet the FA's usually make sure that these passengers remain seated whilst business class passengers can exit first. Given the economies that all airlines are now making, fast track cards are no longer handed out (not a problem for me as I have automatic fast entry at both airports), the main selection of the meal course is reduced to two offerings and the snacks in the bar are not as tasty as they used to be. But that is all rather irrelevant given all the pluses. On the outward sector I was too busy working to dine or use the IFE. I made do with a glass of the superb Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc and a sandwich from the bar. Having eaten well in the lounge, I also declined the meal on the return flight but did enjoy this time a fine Pinot Noir and another chunky chicken sandwich. On this sector I watched a movie and still had time for some classical music before we landed ahead of schedule. For a few months, Emirates replaced the A380 with a 777 on this route. Hopefully the airline will continue with the A380 service for a long time to come."," BKK/HKG/BKK - In ten years of flying with Emirates business class on the short Bangkok to Hong Kong route I have rarely had anything other than an excellent flight.

563,"  Christchurch to Sydney. Certainly not much positive to say about this airline other than the check in team were nice and efficient. All down hill from there, as we were delayed for take-off due to an ill passanger as soon as we had pushed back. No issue with illness, the problem was in Business no service was given to me even when after an hour I finally caught an attendant's eye for another drink and was abruptly told they were preparing for take-off again even though they were waiting on every whim of some other business guests. I'd paid for ""flexi business"" so not a cheap flight, yet the decor in the A380 is not to my taste of immitation golds, printed wood effect panelling with odd blue/grey seat shells, not relaxing or a calming vibe. Seats were otherwise comfortable, IFE remote is terrible for user functionality, and tray-table traps you in the seat so no mid-meal toilet trips. Crew were just a cog in the machine as they weren't personable and seemed distant to interact with everytime. My meal was quite tasty, another issue here was ordering Pinot Noir wasn't possible even simply asking for a red wine, still a blank stare so I gave up after multiple attempts as said pour whatever and ended up an musky white wine I couldn't drink. The attendands all understood English well, so it surprised me that it was so difficult to request a wine and even point at it on the menu! I was delayed and put up in a hotel for the night, however the shuttle driver only knew of one hotel to take us to and unfortunately only some of us were booked there. That hotel now full and multiple calls to Emirates, I was then told I was booked in a average hotel half-hour away even though I was the only Business guest and make my own way to the correct hotel. There weren't any Emirates members at the airport on the ground as many guests went around looking (myself included), so the only contact was once off the aircraft on the bridge an Emirates member told you which shuttle stop and a generic hotel name. All incorrect and one phone call I was told an Emirates ground agent would be waiting at the shuttle stop and they never did. In short if you must fly Emirates only book economy as that's the only value you will receive!","  Christchurch to Sydney.

564,"  My first sector was from Madrid to Dubai. The purser on this flight was the crown jewel of the Emirates hospitality I remembered from my past travels. However she was assigned to business class whilst I was served by one crew who made my Emirates journey an utter disaster. The food on this flight was spectacular. The beef lasagna was great. The entertainment was limited compared to the newer A380s however it did have brilliant things that kept me entertained for 7 hours. Before take off I noticed that a customer who complained of a leaking AC was just shut down by a crew member who said 'cover your head for now, it'll stop after take off'. What a displeasing attitude from an airline renowned to be one of the best in the world.  At the meal service I noticed that meals run out when it comes to the seats at the back. The menu on that flight consisted of a chicken and beef option only, even though traditionally airlines of that calibre opt to offer a vegetarian option too. They had run out of the chicken option and my friend who for religious reasons does not consume beef, was forced with the beef option saying that was all they had. Whilst they refused to eat it, the crew who were called many times didn't even make a single appearance to enquire. Finally when it came to the pre arrival snack, they offered a chicken option and cheese option. The crew member just served the food without asking what I wanted. When I opened I realised I was given the tasteless cheese option. However, the passengers behind us were offered both where they had a choice.  My next flight was from Dubai to Colombo. Another unpleasant journey with the unsuitable comportment of the cabin crew. One of them refused to pour a full glass of apple juice for my father. ","  My first sector was from Madrid to Dubai.

566,"  Colombo to Zurich via Dubai. The last time I flew Emirates I was quite young and overly obsessed by the greatness of its product and inflight service. However, Emirates has decided to put the past behind and embark on a poorly schemed, appalling venture of cost cutting at the cost of passenger comfort whilst still charging passengers exorbitantly. The first sector was from Colombo to Dubai. It was quite acceptable that Emirates never focused on its Asian sectors for they have extreme confidence that it's competitive pricing and brand name would get them customers inevitably. Therefore, I boarded this old 777-300, the inflight entertainment was certainly not much of a great deal on the first sector with quite limited options and by trying to handle it's terribly dysfunctional remote and put it back into its position, the wire had cut my finger. It gave me the worst airplane food ever. The crew on this sector thought were the only appealing segments of what I would call the emisery. They were attentive and kind and maintained a smile but however did not go the extra mile like the qatar airways cabin crew who were an extreme delight. Furthermore, another factor that put me off completely was how narrow and uncomfortable seats were. It was a completely disastrous 4 hours and 10 minutes. The next sector was from Dubai to Zurich with a layover of about 2 hours and 30 minutes. The layover was quite bad with basically no one willing to help us in the airport.  we boarded a brilliant A380 that was the only thing as good as they advertise. Once again a repetitive episode of rude crew and even worse food. We were promised snacks by the airline on a 6 and a half hour flight that we expected would be of some quality - we were given a tiny packet of popcorn. I will never ever fly Emirates or recommend it.","  Colombo to Zurich via Dubai.

We have traveled extensively with other airlines like Etihad, BA, and Lufthansa. But this time, unfortunately, we decided to buy a nightmare by paying way more than other good airlines. It all started with check-in baggage. The check-in counter crew demanded our passports without greeting or smile. In the past, some stuff was stolen from my bags so I asked them to put the zip ties on the locks. After I insisted she threw some plastic zip ties at me and asked to put them on the locks with a red face. They flew one of the filthiest A380 on the planet. The plane looked pretty old with dirty bathrooms and broken seats. I requested the Hindu meal for my family (three of us) and the steward only got two of the meals. I asked him politely about my meals and his response was ""I only got two hands"". Later he came back and said he accidentally gave it to someone else and I have to eat whatever they have left. I later talked to the head of the crew about the incident and she apologized and promised me that she will take care of the next meal. Nothing happened except now ""The steward"" giving us angry looks every time he passes by.

579,"  Kuwait to Amman via Dubai on 3rd July 2019. If you ever depart from Kuwait and are flying Emirates, I’d strongly suggest using online check-in. At KWI, Emirates has a separate counter for online check-in passengers thus enabling passengers to skip the queue and proceed directly to the counter without having to wait. Be aware that during online check-in, you will not receive e-boarding passes if departing from Kuwait. I contacted Emirates and was told this is not an issue. At the counter, I received the boarding passes for both flights EK 856 (KWI-DXB) and my connecting flight EK 903 (DXB-AMM). The check-in experience was smooth, and within 10 minutes, I was through to immigration and security. Online check-in if departing from Kuwait is a lifesaver! First leg EK 856 from Kuwait to Dubai on the B777-300 ER. Boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. It was chaotic as expected for a fully-booked flight. Unfortunately, the aircraft was really old (registration A6-EBE). The screen was very small and ICE version was also very old. 3-4-3 configuration is not a favorite, and the seats felt narrow. Only 1 meal choice and no menus were given. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Kuwait due to late completion of boarding. Luckily, arrival in Dubai was only 5 minutes late despite the 30 minute delay departing Kuwait. If possible, book a seat on the left or right side of the aircraft (rows A, B, C or H, J, K). These seats will feel less cramped than seats in the middle (rows D, E, F, G). I was seated in seat 33A. Overall, a good flight although I’d avoid the EK B777 economy product all-together (unfortunately EK doesn’t fly the A380 to Kuwait so that’s not possible). Second leg EK 903 from Dubai to Amman on the A380-800. First time flying the EK A380! Again, boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. The aircraft was definitely newer (registration A6-EOU). ICE version was newer and screen was much bigger. Still a 3-4-3 configuration however much more comfortable than the 777. Just like the previous flight, no menus were given and there was only 1 meal choice. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Dubai and arrival in Amman was only 3 minutes late. I was seated in seat 78K. Baggage claim at AMM was abysmal! I wonder if the problem lies with Emirates or the baggage handling system at AMM. I can’t really give them much blame due to the fact that the aircraft was an A380, but waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for baggage delivery is still unacceptable! Also, in my opinion, Emirates should really rethink boarding times. Boarding an aircraft 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time surely guarantees a delay. On EK 856, pushback was not until 15 minutes after scheduled departure time and on EK 903, pushback was not until 13 minutes after scheduled departure time! In my opinion, boarding should begin 60 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Also, Emirates should grant its aircraft a 2-hour turn-around time slot. This would give 1 hour to clean and prep the aircraft for boarding and an additional hour to complete boarding, ensuring an on-time departure.","  Kuwait to Amman via Dubai on 3rd July 2019.

At the counter, I received the boarding passes for both flights EK 856 (KWI-DXB) and my connecting flight EK 903 (DXB-AMM). The check-in experience was smooth, and within 10 minutes, I was through to immigration and security. Online check-in if departing from Kuwait is a lifesaver! First leg EK 856 from Kuwait to Dubai on the B777-300 ER. Boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. It was chaotic as expected for a fully-booked flight. Unfortunately, the aircraft was really old (registration A6-EBE). The screen was very small and ICE version was also very old. 3-4-3 configuration is not a favorite, and the seats felt narrow. Only 1 meal choice and no menus were given. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Kuwait due to late completion of boarding. Luckily, arrival in Dubai was only 5 minutes late despite the 30 minute delay departing Kuwait. If possible, book a seat on the left or right side of the aircraft (rows A, B, C or H, J, K). These seats will feel less cramped than seats in the middle (rows D, E, F, G). I was seated in seat 33A. Overall, a good flight although I’d avoid the EK B777 economy product all-together (unfortunately EK doesn’t fly the A380 to Kuwait so that’s not possible). Second leg EK 903 from Dubai to Amman on the A380-800. First time flying the EK A380! Again, boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. The aircraft was definitely newer (registration A6-EOU). ICE version was newer and screen was much bigger. Still a 3-4-3 configuration however much more comfortable than the 777. Just like the previous flight, no menus were given and there was only 1 meal choice. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Dubai and arrival in Amman was only 3 minutes late. I was seated in seat 78K. Baggage claim at AMM was abysmal! I wonder if the problem lies with Emirates or the baggage handling system at AMM. I can’t really give them much blame due to the fact that the aircraft was an A380, but waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for baggage delivery is still unacceptable! Also, in my opinion, Emirates should really rethink boarding times. Boarding an aircraft 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time surely guarantees a delay. On EK 856, pushback was not until 15 minutes after scheduled departure time and on EK 903, pushback was not until 13 minutes after scheduled departure time! In my opinion, boarding should begin 60 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Also, Emirates should grant its aircraft a 2-hour turn-around time slot. This would give 1 hour to clean and prep the aircraft for boarding and an additional hour to complete boarding, ensuring an on-time departure.","[('Kuwait', 'n'), ('Amman', 'n'), ('via', None),

580,"  I was travelling from  Gatwick to Kochi via Dubai and had a small carry on bag and my back pack. I was allowed 7 Kgs and my bag weighed a little over 7 Kgs. I did not have any problem at  Gatwick Airport. I had a connecting flight from Dubai to Kochi. As  Dubai airport duty free had some excellent deals and I ended up buying a couple of bottles of liquor and some chocolates. At the boarding gate, the customer service personnel forced me to weigh my carry on bags again and found 4 Kgs extra due to the items that I bought from the airport and asked me to pay for over weight. I was given 3 options: 1. Throw away the items that I bought from the airport (worth USD$200) 2. Return the items back to the store that was 20 minutes away from the gate 3. Pay for the excess baggage $100 I was put in a very tough situation when I was so tired from my previous two flights (8 hours each). I did not have any other choice than paying for the excess baggage. My advise to anyone travelling through Dubai, is to avoid buying any thing from the duty free if you already have 7 Kgs of items in your carry on baggage. They are going to weigh it at the boarding gate and charge you a huge amount that would kill all the savings that you got from your purchases. I will be happy if at least one person is benefited from this feedback. ","  I was travelling from  Gatwick to Kochi via Dubai and had a small carry on bag and my back pack.

581,"  Dubai to Manchester. The worst cabin service I have experienced on any airline. At great expense I took the flight from Dubai to Manchester yesterday, excited to be trying a business class seat on the A380. I fly often but I have to say this was the worst cabin crew I have ever experienced on any airline. I feel as if I paid for them to have a great holiday. I know that other passengers felt the same way. We were all SO upset that we talked to each other about it both on the plane and afterwards. From the moment of boarding, there was no usual warm welcome. I was greeted by a very grumpy hostile cabin attendant. When she brought the breakfast menu later she couldn’t answer simple questions about the ingredients. “I can’t say”. “Could you please find out?” “No, the meal is precooked, we can’t tell”. I have never had that response before. The crew stood and sat at the back chatting away having a great time. There were many of them and few passengers. A perfect opportunity to showcase individual, fantastic service. Unfortunately, the head of the cabin crew was at the back chatting with them all – so there was little leadership. After complaints from passengers, nothing changed. On take-off they did not remove our glasses, on landing they did not check that we were strapped in, they did not remove our cups and glasses once again. I choked on my breakfast and tried to call for help. I waved and pressed the service button. No one came. I managed to scramble out of my seat, balance my tray on the side and get to the bathroom where I vomited. The food was appalling, dry and over cooked. My tea was served cold. The attendant was so grumpy, rude and unhelpful that I actually asked her whether she’d had bad news from home. She said “I am tired!” I paid thousands of very hard-earned money for this flight – it is not the passengers’ job to do the work of the tired, disgruntled crew! They kept one toilet locked. They did not walk through the cabin to see if the passengers were ok. They did not help the mother with her 3 year old across the aisle from me. Airlines need to understand – we passengers no longer want glamour, lipstick, tight skirts and high heels – we want professional, great service from intelligent crew - happy to be in their highly sought-after jobs!","  Dubai to Manchester.

583,"  Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai. Despite recent reports about the extent to which Emirates’ quality of service has declined, I was impressed with every aspect of these two A380 flights. The limo pickup was on time with a friendly and helpful driver and there was only a short walk to business checkin. The Emirates lounge at Birmingham airport is spacious and well stocked and was only an equally short walk to the gate. Boarding was prompt and I will shown to my seat. There was a good choice of food and it was well served. My only criticism would have been the delay in bringing a glass of wine, forgetting my post-flight drink and having to ask to top it up. Apart from that the food was delicious and in a reasonable portions. The first A380 had the new design for the bar and there was a friendly group of passengers. The transfer at Dubai was quick and painless although allowing both economy and business passengers to exit through the same time did add some delay to exiting the aircraft. The flight to Bangkok was overnight and I chose to sleep. With the mattress, the seat was comfortable and I managed to sleep for a good three hours before being awoken for breakfast. The Wi-Fi connection on the plane was surprisingly stable and fast and there were enough movies to keep me entertained. Having flown on Emirates on a number of occasions in the past, I was relieved that although other accounts may be accurate, I found these two flights to high standard with nothing significant to complain about. The cabin crew were chatty and friendly and always keen to help answer any questions or respond to requests.","  Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai.

I tried my special meal (acknowledge!) and all the other three menu dishes announced. All were absolutely substandard and not edible and I am not difficult and usually eat the dogs leftovers. But this was horrible and hazardous. Food in economy was edible and better than business. There was a cheese plate that helped me to avoid to starve. No ice creams and no inspirational additionals. Rate 6/10 Dubai-Bangkok was a great experience - as good as it gets on an airplane. A380 must be the king of the skies. Likely of my best flight ever, despite I had not slept the night before. I doubt that a general 1st class experience can beat this luxurious bz-class experience by Emirates on the A380. Simply outstanding on seat “hut”, meals, drinks. The onboard Sky Bar is a solid social effort and gimmick that is impressive and hard to dislike. I like the outer seats in the 1-2-1 biz-configuration with lots of space and great window access. The sports car design works well for me and the WiFi is solid and a bonus. Special meal was sophisticated and made to perfection. Rate 10/10 Lounge provided in Addis is the Ethiopian Cloud Nine Lounge which is slightly better than their Gold lounge. Seems this lounge is improving due to Emirates as they now serve the same champagne available on board."," ADD-DXB-BKK on 14th June 2019 on B777-300ER and A380, respectively.

Seat selection is not complimentary and the cost disproportionate: the cheapest option for each of the 4 legs of my journey would have increased the ticket price by around 17%! Cabin service is close to no-frill airlines: no hot towel, no amenity kit, no staff walking around the aisle with trays of drinks during sleeping hours. The inflight entertainment on the A380 was a quite unresponsive touch screen with cursor. Charging plugs are only available to window and central seat. Worse part: the staff. I was told that an increasing number of Europeans had joined Emirates from Ryanair and I was displeased to see the same attitude brought to the 4-star airline. Apart from the lack of smiles and rough replies to some passengers that I could hear, the staff onboard the SIN-DXB night flight had been talking and laughing loudly in the galley for at least one hour after the light were switched off, going in and out without caring to seal the courtains. I have not seen such behaviour even on cheap low-cost carriers like Scoot or AirAsia, where the staff at least excercises the basic courtesy of letting their passengers sleep.

Such a horrible customer service I never expected from Emirates, especially when traveling in business class. On-Board Experience: It’s Ramadan (fasting month for Muslims) month and I was fasting. Cabin crew informed me if am fasting then food will be served when it’s time to break my fasting but I should order the food in advance so that I get served. When it was time of breaking my fasting I asked for the food that was ordered in advance and very surprisingly crew told sorry we can’t serve the food and you need to adjust with a small sandwich box as we are planning to land. When I questioned crew why did they promised me to order food in advance and how can they deny serving the food for a fasting person then crew simply said it’s our policy and we can’t help. When I became furious then they simply gave me a quick main course to eat but I felt their frustration while getting served. I wasn’t served the food which I had preordered despite crew having enough time (around one hour was left to land the flight). Most of the passengers sitting around me enjoyed full meal (all items of menu) but I had to go through this bad experience because I was fasting. Crew argued a lot with me to explain that full meal will be served only during initial serving time and not later even if someone is fasting.

All hand carry was measured and weighed also for business class passengers. This is the first time on over 200 long haul business class flights I have ever experienced this.

All economy passengers seated on the 2 aisle are boarded through the front door and has to pass through business class to get to their seat. As a business class passenger this means a lot of noise and commotion, no service until boarding is complete and being hit several times by carry on luggage. No service/bad service continued through out the flight with no drinks being offered during meals and no attention to passengers at all. It seemed the flight was understaffed due to a full business class.","  Dubai to Manila. Emirates seems to be an airline where economy passengers are more important than business class passengers.

Not having a choice, we decided to take this flight having in mind that we need to be in Delhi on Sunday. We reached Dubai on 24th of May and we saw that the flight from Dubai to New Delhi has not been cancelled and departure was ongoing what means that they lie to us saying that the flight was cancelled. Once we noticed, we run to the reservation desk, was huge line but finally we asked if we can change the flight for 21:25 as originally planned. They said no, we cannot it is already overbooked, and boarding is closed. She said there is an option at 3 am as well but it is also overbooked, 30 people on the list so she all not adds to the waiting list even. Not having a choice, we decided to go out from the airport because no one told us that emirates should give us a hotel.

603,"  Dubai to New York JFK. We couldn’t afford buying a Business ticket since it was way too expensive so we started using AMEX credit card to get as many miles as possible and use them for the upgrade. Finally after a few months spending money and taking advantage of different promotions we collected more than half of the miles, the rest we bought them through emirates website (very expensive!). First problem started a week before our trip when we tried to reserve the chauffeur Emirates offer for Business class passengers, apparently they remove it from miles upgraded tickets a week before we made the upgrade (they didn’t say it unless you try to actually use it and they tell you that you can’t due to the type of ticket). Emirates has a direct flight from Dubai to FLL but upgrade tickets where not available when we bought them so we decided to go through JFK with our upgrade ticket, since we were coming from Bangkok we arrived at Dubai airport at midnight and our flight to JFK departed 8:15am (8hours stopover), during our honeymoon I checked the Dubai-FLL flight multiple times until we saw tickets available for upgrade, so we called Emirates to change it (this change would make us arrive at FLL 12 hours earlier since the stop over in Dubai was only 2 hours and we didn’t have to stop in JFK for another 3 hours and take an extra flight) the guy in the phone told us that through the phone he couldn’t guarantee that we would get business seats in the new flight since he had to revert the upgrade, transfer the economy ticket and request the upgrade again, but he recommended us to do it at the airport, if they had seats available they would be able to do it without a problem. When we got to Bangkok airport I checked online once again and the seats where still available so we spoke with the Senior Lounge Agent, she was extremely unhelpful and harsh with us, first I tried to explain the situation nicely but she didn’t care, and her response was “I’m sorry but in order to change we have to revert back the upgrade and the miles take 24-48 hours to be back in your account so you wont be able to upgrade for this flight”. It is disappointing because the guy over the phone told us exactly the opposite (wait until you get to the airport) and second because you are flying in business paying a lot of money (or a lot of miles) but they don’t seem to care, also since you have an upgrade ticket is for them as if you still have your economy ticket the attention is really bad. I regret a lot flying with Emirates, during our honeymoon we flew business with Qatar & Cathay and they were better, you cannot compare.","  Dubai to New York JFK.

604,  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Trip was relatively nice. Checked in around 11:PM at Suvarnabhumi International airport located the Emirates counter all the way at the back. What I found a bit strange that they were still about 4 or 5 people ahead of us in the business class counter and the first class counter was completely empty. Once checked in we (finally) didn’t have to go to the payment counter for overweight luggage since we had around 40KG baggage allowance. Got fast track passes so the security and immigration was a breeze.Once customs was over we headed to the lounge and had some water and tea. (Didn’t eat much not gonna lie) then we checked the Duty free a bit and headed to the gate. We got priority boarding so we didn’t have to wait that much. We entered the aero bridge and were welcomed by the cabin crew and located our assigned seats. Legroom was very decent the recline seating options were amazing for me and the flat bed was really easy and effective. IFE was amazing and the screen was fairly large.The headphones worked well and so did the tray table functions. What I found very useful was the storage space beside my seat. It even had its own minibar with Evian and Perrier and something else (not gonna lie I don’t remember). The food was ok p(not the best) and so was the onboard lounge and restrooms. Slept for about a hour since the flight is pretty short. And arrived at Hong Kong International Airport.

605,"  Istanbul to Dubai. 1st leg: fr Sofia to Istanbul by Turkish Airlines (Apr 26:16-17:15) 2nd leg: fr Istanbul to Dubai (Apr 26: 19:25- Apr 27: 1pm) 3rd leg: fr Dubai to HK First, when I checked in online, the system said since the first leg was operated by Turkish, I could not do so. When I checked in in Sofia, Turkish  said I needed to get my other boarding passes from Emirates in Istanbul. The arrival time from Sofia to Istanbul was delayed by 15 mins & it took about 15 mins for the plane to drive to the parking terminal. Since my seat was at the end of the plane, it took another 15 mins for me to leave the plane. Then I ran around to find the transfer desk of Emirates. But I couldn't find any sign in the airport indicating where it was & the airport is very large. I asked many airport staff but they either did not know it or pointed me in the wrong direction. Finally I could find one airport staff member pointed me to the right location. When I arrived at the transfer desk, it was about 18:28 & the Celebi staff representing Emirates was not there & someone went inside the office behind to get him out. After he was out & checked the system, he said the checkin was closed.  He called his supervisor to see if they could let me check in. The answer was NO & he could not do anything else. I was angry because there was still about an hour before takeoff. He then said since my previous plane was delayed for 15 mins, Turkish should bear the responsibility. I then approached Turkish Airlines and asked 2 different staff members, they said 15 mins was just a short time & there was still about an hour before the next plane took off. Then there came the deadlock. I looked like an idiot running between the 2 airlines. They all treated me in bad attitude at the end, thinking I was a trouble maker. So the only thing I could do then was to book another air ticket. It costed me HK$4259.08 & 30 hours more. To me, I cannot understand why I couldn't check in when there was still about an hour before takeoff. I've just called Emirates' customer service, they said I must check in 1 hour before takeoff.

The experience is the worst I ever have.","[('Istanbul', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('.', None), ('1st', None), ('leg', 'n'), (':', None), ('fr', 'n'), ('Sofia', 'n'), ('Istanbul', 'n'), ('Turkish', 'n'), ('Airlines', 'n'), ('(', None), ('Apr', 'n'), ('26:16-17:15', None), (')', None), ('2nd', None), ('leg', 'n'), (':', None), ('fr', 'n'), ('Istanbul', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('(', None), ('Apr', 'n'), ('26', None), (':', None), ('19:25-', 'a'), ('Apr', 'n'), ('27', None), (':', None), ('1pm', None), (')', None), ('3rd', None), ('leg', 'n'), (':', None), ('fr', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('HK', 'n'), ('First', 'n'), (',', None), ('checked', 'v'), ('online', 'n'), (',', None), ('system', 'n'), ('said', 'v'), ('since', None), ('first', 'a'), ('leg', 'n'), ('operated', 'v'), ('Turkish', 'n'), (',', None), ('could', None), ('.', None), ('checked', 'v'), ('Sofia', 'n'), (',', None), ('Turkish', 'n'), ('said', 'v'), ('needed', 'v'), ('get', 'v'), ('boarding', 'a'), ('passes', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('Istanbul', 'n'), ('.', None), ('arrival', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('Sofia', 'n'), ('Istanbul', 'n'), ('delayed', 'v'), ('15', None), ('mins', 'n'), ('&', None), ('took', 'v'), ('15', None), ('mins', 'n'), ('plane', 'n'), ('drive', 'v'), ('parking', 'v'), ('terminal', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Since', None), ('seat', 'n'), ('end', 'n'), ('plane', 'n'), (',', None), ('took', 'v'), ('another', None), ('15', None), ('mins', 'n'), ('leave', 'v'), ('plane', 'n'), ('.', None), ('ran', 'v'), ('around', 'r'), ('find', 'v'), ('transfer', 'n'), ('desk', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('.', None), ('could', None), (""n't"", 'r'), ('find', 'v'), ('sign', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('indicating', 'v'), ('&', None), ('airport', 'n'), ('large', 'a'), ('.', None), ('asked', 'v'), ('many', 'a'), ('airport', 'a'), ('staff', 'n'), ('either', 'r'), ('know', 'v'), ('pointed', 'v'), ('wrong', 'a'), ('direction', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Finally', 'r'), ('could', None), ('find', 'v'), ('one', None), ('airport', 'a'), ('staff', 'n'), ('member', 'n'), ('pointed', 'v'), ('right', 'a'), ('location', 'n'), ('.', None), ('arrived', 'v'), ('transfer', 'n'), ('desk', 'n'), (',', None), ('18:28', None), ('&', None), ('Celebi', 'n'), ('staff', 'n'), ('representing', 'v'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('&', None), ('someone', 'n'), ('went', 'v'), ('inside', None), ('office', 'n'), ('behind', 'n'), ('get', 'v'), ('.', None), ('&', None), ('checked', 'v'), ('system', 'n'), (',', None), ('said', 'v'), ('checkin', 'n'), ('closed', 'v'), ('.', None), ('called', 'v'), ('supervisor', 'n'), ('see', 'v'), ('could', None), ('let', 'v'), ('check', 'v'), ('.', None), ('answer', 'n'), ('&', None), ('could', None), ('anything', 'n'), ('else', 'r'), ('.', None), ('angry', 'a'), ('still', 'r'), ('hour', 'n'), ('takeoff', 'n'), ('.', None), ('said', 'v'), ('since', None), ('previous', 'a'), ('plane', 'n'), ('delayed', 'v'), ('15', None), ('mins', 'n'), (',', None), ('Turkish', 'n'), ('bear', 'v'), ('responsibility', 'n'), ('.', None), ('approached', 'v'), ('Turkish', 'n'), ('Airlines', 'n'), ('asked', 'v'), ('2', None), ('different', 'a'), ('staff', 'n'), ('members', 'n'), (',', None), ('said', 'v'), ('15', None), ('mins', 'n'), ('short', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('&', None), ('still', 'r'), ('hour', 'n'), ('next', 'a'), ('plane', 'n'), ('took', 'v'), ('.', None), ('came', 'v'), ('deadlock', 'n'), ('.', None), ('looked', 'v'), ('like', None), ('idiot', 'n'), ('running', 'v'), ('2', None), ('airlines', 'n'), ('.', None), ('treated', 'v'), ('bad', 'a'), ('attitude', 'n'), ('end', 'n'), (',', None), ('thinking', 'v'), ('trouble', 'n'), ('maker', 'n'), ('.', None), ('thing', 'n'), ('could', None), ('book', 'n'), ('another', None), ('air', 'n'), ('ticket', 'n'), ('.', None), ('costed', 'v'), ('HK', 'n'), ('$', None), ('4259.08', None), ('&', None), ('30', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('.', None), (',', None), ('understand', 'v'), ('could', None), (""n't"", 'r'), ('check', 'v'), ('still', 'r'), ('hour', 'n'), ('takeoff', 'n'), ('.', None), (""'ve"", 'v'), ('called', 'v'), ('Emirates', 'n'), (""'"", None), ('customer', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), (',', None), ('said', 'v'), ('must', None), ('check', 'v'), ('1', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('takeoff', 'n'), ('.', None), ('experience', 'n'), ('worst', 'a'), ('ever', 'r'), ('.', None)]","  Istanbul Dubai . 1st leg : fr Sofia Istanbul Turkish Airlines ( Apr 26:16-17:15 ) 2nd leg : fr Istanbul Dubai ( Apr 26 : 19:25- Apr 27 : 1pm ) 3rd leg : fr Dubai HK First , check online , system say since first leg operate Turkish , could . check Sofia , Turkish say need get boarding pass Emirates Istanbul . arrival time Sofia Istanbul delay 15 min & take 15 min plane drive park terminal .

606,"  Bangkok to Brussels via Dubai. I've flown them roughly every three years or so for the last two decades and they seem as good as ever. They're not perfect, and some other carriers have done a good job of catching up (particularly in economy class) but Emirates is still one of the better choices. The check in team and gate agents are efficient and patient. I had a problem with my mobile boarding pass not scanning and they were able to print me a new paper one with a smile. The aircraft was an older 777, but still mostly functional--there was a problem with the seat recline on my second segment. The entertainment system is good, but trying to cater to every culture they serve means the pool of options for English is pretty shallow. I was able to keep myself entertained, but just barely. Comedy is a weak spot for sure. The two hours of free wifi is good, but the connection is pretty poor. Emirates food is decent, though one flight only had an option of lamb or cod. Those are both rather specific tastes, I'd have been happier if they had gone with at least one safer choice of beef, chicken, or pasta. But the food was good and the desserts definitely stand out. Emirates doesn't stack up to the Asian carriers in terms of frequently circulating with water between meals, but the crew seemed service focused enough that you would get some if you asked. Connecting in Dubai is not a great experience. It's not as horrible as Doha but there is an amazing lack of plumbing in the airport, ensuring long lines at the toilets. Add to that some really extensive walks to get from gate to gate, and I'd be wary of advising any mobility impaired friends to try this without assistance. The flights were close to on time, but both arrived a little bit late without any logical explanation--no headwinds, ATC delays, or other obvious issues. Despite all those little negatives, Emirates is still a top notch experience.","  Bangkok to Brussels via Dubai.

607,"  Newcastle to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai . I have flown with Emirates on and off for years, and you can really see cost cutting and staff attitudes changing, on my flights anyway. Their bar service is non existent more or less, you get offered a drink with your meal, and thats about it, if you want a drink of anything you have to keep ring for service, which most folk like myself dont like to do. No hot towels on getting on the craft, your just left, food has notably gone down in quality too! On the second leg of the flight, it was a 4.20am takeoff, we were left without so much as a drink of water for 3 hours, i had medication to take and asked them for water, , they must have a water shortage! It was brought in an eggcup size cup. Eventually got brought a substandard breakfast, which has been so chilled its lost all its flavour, no alcohol offered on this flight. The service has massively changed, you can really see it is like the staff cant be bothered, just wanna chuck the food at you, so they can rest and talk in the galley. I paid £700 for my flight and felt ripped off, it would put me off travelling with them again. However, it is very handy from Newcastle upon Tyne to get a bit further afield, come on Emirates, get your act together! One positive is the IFE, very good.","  Newcastle to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai .

I was told yes, you don`t have to have it in checked baggage. Then at the security check right before the boarding gate I was told and forced to put drone into checked luggage, but I was not provided any bag for that and that I have to take care of it myself that it`s my mistake I was told by Emirates staff at the gate, BUT thanks to local security officers on airport (not emirates staff) They helped me to find bag, some papers and airbags to secure the drone. I said OK nice start, but then it continued with the service onboard. The menu was served after 2 hours after the take off and no walkaround of staff around. No water offer, only if you come by person to staff asking for water or something. The food was average - good taste, selection of 2 main food chicken vs beef and drinks. I asked for a beer and I was told they run out of beer. so I asked for Gin and Soda, and I was told, I dont have it with me but if you wait 10-15 minutes I will get it right back for you, and I waited approx 20 mins to get the gin and tonic. You can see attached picture of the snack we were offered, and I was like really, you can select small pretzels or kitkat?  I can only say that the seat comfort (176cm tall) and entertainment - big screen was the only positive about the flight. ","  Prague to Bangkok via Dubai.

Later had to rush thru the gate with rude staff. Had flown before, but their standard and staff are not up to the expectations any more.  They should improve their services to Indian routes who are paying the same money. Mostly double standards. As mentioned in other reviews food is basic.","  Me and a toddler flew from Dubai to Kochi.

611,"  Singapore to Brisbane. This is the first time we have flown this route with Emirates for a few years. The chauffeur was very friendly and polite even offering to stop/slow down for photos I was taking. The lounge was great, the food was very good as is usual in the Emirates own lounges. The hot food was very good with a good choice of Asian dishes, and we especially loved the freshly made to order dumplings. The only let down was that they served Moet and not Veuve Cliquot which was what was previously on offer. On board the cabin layout of 3-2-3 was disappointing and the seat comfort was not good. However the aircraft was very clean and well maintained. The service to start off was a bit hit and miss, although did improve after the meal service. Champagne on board again was only Moet. The promised drinks after takeoff was not delivered until we reminded them and also the wines we had already ordered with our meals did not eventuate until reminded a couple of times. The food was good but nothing exciting, with no dine on demand or pre ordering available which I think would be an improvement. No amenity kits, only socks and eyeshades provided.","  Singapore to Brisbane. This is the first time we have flown this route with Emirates for a few years.

612," First time for a long time with Emirates - normally I would use Etihad, and first time A380 business class. Overall, a curates's egg. However, you come to expect more from Emirates particularly given the cost of their flights. The good points: check in and bag delivery was excellent, as was the chauffeur service to / from DXB. The cabin appeared spotless, though all was not as it seemed. The crew were immaculate and charming if a little robotic. The quibbles: boarding at DXB was chaotic. It should not take nearly 2 hours to clear queuing passengers into the gate, the flight eventually leaving 90 minutes behind schedule. On the flight to CAN I was not welcomed onboard, or offered a drink, or a drink order taken on the return. If paying top dollar there is an expectation FAs keep tabs on their assigned passengers. However, the biggest disappointment was the food. I'd pre-ordered vegetarian. On the outward leg I was presented what I considered at the time to be the most uninspired slop I'd seen in nearly 50 years of flying, boiled mixed vegetables in a tasteless sauce on couscous. Until my return flight, that is. A 'dish' of boiled noodles with a squirt of neat tomato puree on top and accompanies by half a dozen near raw peas in their pods. The excellent sweet did not compensate. The FA apologized and offered any selection from the menu as an alternative. Trouble is, unlike other full fare airlines, including for economy class (Etihad), Emirates offers no vegetarian - or vegan - options. One assumes Emirates' management would rather vegetarians stay away. Henceforth I shall duly support this policy. I strongly recommend other vegetarians do likewise. Finally, I enjoy watching wildlife programmes as part of IFE. What I appreciate less is being 'entertained' through the night by the antics of a cockroach presumably making its way home through my seating area disappearing into the seat recess in front. Where there's one there'll be many more. Which rather sums up Emirates: a glossy veneer but rather grubby beneath."," First time for a long time with Emirates - normally I would use Etihad, and first time A380 business class.

613,"  I was very much looking forward to Emirates flight and had pre-set expectations of high standards of service and comfort. I was traveling with my Mother on the flight and I must say that the flight was pretty average nowhere close to Emirates brand of service. A couple of gripes on their Boeing 777 from Mumbai - Dubai - flown 07 March 2019. Inattentive cabin crew - No response to hostess call bell multiple times, had to verbally call out for assistance.  No water provided on boarding the aircraft and you had to ask for water and that also was cheaply been distributed in open plastic glasses the way they do it by the road side in India pouring out of packaged drinking water bottles. For more than an hour no water or snacks were offered and the food that was served was average and that was it, no munchies or a bottle of water before the dinner was served. Getting a glass of juice was a challenge and everything was being served very stingily. 5The flight seats are of very poor width since the flight is crammed with lot many seats per row, the food tray could barely fit on it. Uncomfortable aisles and poor comfort overall. The positive -  The inflight entertainment and camera view, that was the only saving grace.  Comparatively new flight and clean upholstery. Conclusion - For me Emirates was as average as any other full service airlines in India. Not too happy about the overrated hype regarding brand Emirates especially on Indian routes.","  I was very much looking forward to Emirates flight and had pre-set expectations of high standards of service and comfort.

614," What happened on EK-001 on 9th May 2019? I've flown Emirates many times with excellent service, but this flight was disgusting. I get a special meal, gluten free, so my food arrived 30 mins before the general rush, then the normal food distribution. The food trays were then left (on people's laps) for maybe '4 hours'. This made it awkward to get up as one had to ask a neighbour to hold your tray plus their tray to go the toilet. I plan my in-flight experience down to exactly which seat and which meal, to minimise inconvenience, but this didn't work on EK-001 (09/05/19). Drinks trolleys were abandoned opposite toilets making for less space to stand. The flight standard was all the worse because I had just got off the excellent flight from Perth, Australia, arriving at gate A1 departing gate A3. It was such a shock coming from a serene feeling on a flight inbound to their Dubai hub, and the excellent experience in their hub, plus the great flights out to Australia. It genuinely felt as if the stewards were on strike. (This was the flight where we were told at the end, suitcases in hand, packed in the aisles, to return to our allocated seats because the British police were coming on board.). Come on, Emirates! You blew it here."," What happened on EK-001 on 9th May 2019? I've flown Emirates many times with excellent service, but this flight was disgusting.

615,"  After 1 month in Thailand and the prospect of coming home to rainy Scotland, I decided to treat myself and upgrade my original economy ticket to business class. Okay I'll get all the positives out the way first. Great lounge at BKK, fully stocked with drinks and all the food I had was very tasty and prepared to a high standard. Seat and all the amenities that come with it were spot on, this is for the A380. The B777 is a more cramped affair altogether, so if you can, fly on the A380 - this applies to economy as well. I loved relaxing at the A380 bar area, watching the football on the big screen, whilst enjoying a freshly made cocktail, bliss! Now the negative, yes, just one, but it's a biggie and that would be the service. Now, don't get me wrong, there were some very pleasant FA's, albeit a bit false but as for the others it's the reason I won't fly Emirates again. After dinner I had a full glass of champagne in front of me, the FA tried to snatch it away, I don't understand this and why would you not ask the customer if they are finished? Needless to say, I snatched it back, much to the FA's annoyance, forgive me for wanting to finish my drink when I'm paying good money. Another point is the staff just hanging around the bar towards the end of the flight, as thought it was their own staff room, I wanted to just chill and spend the last couple hours of my flight reading my book but this just totally put me off. I work in hospitality myself and believe those areas are for the customer and the customer only not for staff to drape themselves over. Upon arrival at the lounge in Dubai, I gave my ticket to receptionist and as I was off a flight and a bit tired I made the heinous mistake of going the wrong way ""Where are you going sir"" was said to me in the tone of ""what are doing you complete and utter buffoon"", not pleasant in the slightest, such a sour character and one you wonder why bother working with the public? So in a nutshell, great food, IFE, seats etc etc. But very, average service, bordering on downright rude at times. For this reason I'll be trying Singapore in future and avoiding Emirates entirely. It's a bad day when a low cost carrier like Easyjet are miles ahead of you in the service department.","  After 1 month in Thailand and the prospect of coming home to rainy Scotland, I decided to treat myself and upgrade my original economy ticket to business class.

616,"  We travelled Emirates yet again because we are moving back to England. This one-way flight was a pleasant one. The airport wasn't a pigsty like it usually is when we travel in the summertime. The cabin staff and ground staff are very friendly. When we were at the airport, however, we had to pay AED120 for baggage wrapping only because they didn't have plastic, which isn't very fair, but anyhow. Boarding gate was pretty busy and it was a full flight. It was fairly pleasant on board - no screaming babies for the majority of the duration of flight but just when we took off there was one family with a crying baby. ICE is great but children's selection of films is lousy. Good music on the flight - almost every song i wanted to listen to E-section (Entertainment) had.

618,"  I flew out LHR-DXB on economy and was upgraded to business for the return flight. Economy was not too busy so had middle seat free. Check-in was fine and meal quality for economy was pretty good. ICE had a big choice. Flight left a bit late but caught up. 30 minute wait to get my bag at DXB. Return flight - check-in took forever, not enough attendants but getting upgraded to business certainly made up for it. I travelled business on Emirates about 4 years ago and seat configuration has improved and having access to the stand-up bar was great. if I had been paying for business I would have been a bit miffed that my first choice of steak had already gone by the time I was asked. My first course of arabic mezze was served with a choice of breads but no arabic wraps/breads which would have been a far better accompaniment.Main course of seafood biriani was prawns hidden in a flavoured rice, pleasant but nothing remarkable and a bit dry. Pudding of Mango millefeuille was excellent. Choice of wines was fine. Arrival at LGW was on time and luggage came out quickly but given it was North Terminal we had a 15 minute walk to get there.","  I flew out LHR-DXB on economy and was upgraded to business for the return flight.

I travelled business on Emirates about 4 years ago and seat configuration has improved and having access to the stand-up bar was great. if I had been paying for business I would have been a bit miffed that my first choice of steak had already gone by the time I was asked. My first course of arabic mezze was served with a choice of breads but no arabic wraps/breads which would have been a far better accompaniment.Main course of seafood biriani was prawns hidden in a flavoured rice, pleasant but nothing remarkable and a bit dry. Pudding of Mango millefeuille was excellent. Choice of wines was fine. Arrival at LGW was on time and luggage came out quickly but given it was North Terminal we had a 15 minute walk to get there.","[('flew', 'v'), ('LHR-DXB', 'n'), ('economy', 'n'), ('upgraded', 'v'), ('business', 'n'), ('return', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Economy', 'n'), ('busy', 'a'), ('middle', 'a'), ('seat', 'n'), ('free', 'a'), ('.', None), ('Check-in', 'n'), ('fine', 'a'), ('meal', 'a'), ('quality', 'n'), ('economy', 'n'), ('pretty', 'r'), ('good', 'a'), ('.', None), ('ICE', 'n'), ('big', 'a'), ('choice', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Flight', 'n'), ('left', 'v'), ('bit', 'n'), ('late', 'a'), ('caught', 'v'), ('.', None), ('30', None), ('minute', 'a'), ('wait', 'n'), ('get', 'v'), ('bag', 'n'), ('DXB', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Return', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('-', None), ('check-in', 'n'), ('took', 'v'), ('forever', 'r'), (',', None), ('enough', 'a'), ('attendants', 'n'), ('getting', 'v'), ('upgraded', 'a'), ('business', 'n'), ('certainly', 'r'), ('made', 'v'), ('.', None), ('travelled', 'v'), ('business', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('4', None), ('years', 'n'), ('ago', 'r'), ('seat', 'n'), ('configuration', 'n'), ('improved', 'v'), ('access', 'n'), ('stand-up', 'a'), ('bar', 'n'), ('great', 'a'), ('.', None), ('paying', 'v'), ('business', 'n'), ('would', None), ('bit', 'n'), ('miffed', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('choice', 'n'), ('steak', 'n'), ('already', 'r'), ('gone', 'v'), ('time', 'n'), ('asked', 'v'), ('.', None), ('first', 'a'), ('course', 'n'), ('arabic', 'a'), ('mezze', 'n'), ('served', 'v'), ('choice', 'n'), ('breads', 'n'), ('arabic', 'a'), ('wraps/breads', 'n'), ('would', None), ('far', 'r'), ('better', 'a'), ('accompaniment.Main', 'a'), ('course', 'n'), ('seafood', 'n'), ('biriani', 'n'), ('prawns', 'a'), ('hidden', 'n'), ('flavoured', 'a'), ('rice', 'n'), (',', None), ('pleasant', 'a'), ('nothing', 'n'), ('remarkable', 'a'), ('bit', 'n'), ('dry', 'a'), ('.', None), ('Pudding', 'v'), ('Mango', 'n'), ('millefeuille', 'n'), ('excellent', 'a'), ('.', None), ('Choice', 'n'), ('wines', 'n'), ('fine', 'a'), ('.', None), ('Arrival', 'n'), ('LGW', 'n'), ('time', 'n'), ('luggage', 'n'), ('came', 'v'), ('quickly', 'r'), ('given', 'v'), ('North', 'n'), ('Terminal', 'n'), ('15', None), ('minute', 'n'), ('walk', 'n'), ('get', 'v'), ('.', None)]","  fly LHR-DXB economy upgrade business return flight .

619,  Dubai to Johannesburg. Absolute horrific customer service. As I approved I informed the lady I’m flying to Johannesburg and the count will close soon. (20 minutes) she said it’s fine I need to wait in the queue. of about 19/20 counters there was one person working. There was about 9 passengers in front of me. I waited as told. When I reached the counter finally the lady told me I missed my check in (by 5 minutes) as I was waiting. She refused to help or assist and told me I need to speak to another counter. The manager that he is just said I need to rebook and it’s not his problem. As I booked my flight through a third party (my fault) and was checked in already I lost both my flights as I was a no show. This cost me AED 4500 roughly. Emirates has really lost its wow factor with ground staff attitudes. Might as well be all automatic as they will be more pleasant. Most horrible and very expensive experience.

620," I and my wife took the flight from Cape Town to Dubai (EK773) and Dubai to Hong Kong (EK382) on 27 Apr to 28 Apr 2019. After we alight the flight (EK773) in Dubai airport at the remote bay, I immediately recalled that I left 3 bottles of liquor on the aircraft during the bus ride to the terminal. It was about 00:30L 28 Apr 2019. Once we arrived at the terminal, we sought help from an Emirates staff, he asked me to go to the information desk. Then we sought the information desk to help, the information desk staff refer me to the transit connection counter. Then we went to connection counter to ask for help. The connection counter staff asked us to wait for one hour there, she said she would see if anyone retrieved anything from the aircraft. Please note that at this point, no staff took note of any of our PAX information. I waited for an hour and went back to the connection counter. The encounter staff dialled Lost & Found and simply passed me the phone to me. The Lost & Found said the aircraft has not been cleared, nothing has retrieved from the aircraft. Since it was about the boarding time for our next flight, I asked my wife to head to the boarding gate and ask the gate staff to help and I waited for 15 mins more. Once my wife arrived at the gate and asked for help. Again, the gate staff simply passed the phone to my wife and asked her to talk to Lost & Found. At this time, the Lost & Found lady told my wife the aircraft has been cleared and nothing has been retrieved. I arrived at the gate 15 mins later. I was so angry because no ground staff were trying to help and none of them seemed care at all. Their service attitude was terrible! The gate staff explained that maybe other PAX took them. I claimed that we were the last PAX to alight the aircraft since we knew we have 3 hrs for transit therefore we didn't need to rush. At this point, we gave up and entered the waiting area at Gate A8. 15 mins later, I decided to ask the gate staff to call the Lost & Found again and let me talk to the Lost & Found directly. This time, the Lost & Found staff told me the aircraft has not been cleared, nothing has been retrieved yet. What is going on? I told her no one recorded any of my PAX information. Then she asked me to send an e-mail to [email protected] as it is the standard procedure for Emirates. I sent the e-mail right away and they acknowledged my query. 24 hours has passed and I still hear nothing! This was my first time flying with Emirates and it was terrible! I understood I was my mistake to leave my liquor on the aircraft. But how can I expect no ground staff actually care to help at all. I had reported the left-over items immediately and I couldn't get them back during the 3 hours transit!"," I and my wife took the flight from Cape Town to Dubai (EK773) and Dubai to Hong Kong (EK382) on 27 Apr to 28 Apr 2019.

622," Had 2 great flights from Kuwait to Dubai and back with Emirates. The last time I flown Emirates was back in 2015, I then switched to Qatar Airways which I found is better. My recent flight with Emirates was great overall. But yes, their services went down (seat selection no longer free, 25kg only for Economy Class, no more hot towels served prior to departure in Economy Class. Other negatives are: WiFi was available but not working on both flights. IFE Box under the seats blocking some legroom. Very tiring boarding organization unlike Qatar Airways, Emirates closes the gate 45 minutes prior to departure time, while Qatar Airways closes the gate 20 minutes prior to departure time. Emirates’s 45 minutes causes a long long queue. Postives, good and comfortable seats, the 10-abreast B777-300ER is decent, not as bad as people say. Of course I won’t deny the Award-Winning Excellent ICE Entertainment System. Despite both flights were operated on old planes with very unresponsive touch screens, the movies selection were up-to-date.

623,"  Vienna to Sulaymaniyah via Dubai. We missed our connection flight with another airline company and were unable to get a continuing flight with that company for another 3 days. We searched the other airlines and could fly with Emirates within 4 hours - best decision we made! When we checked in they noted that we have 3 young children and changed our seats so we could have the front row seats enabling us to sit together and also be able to use their onboard cot for our 9 month old. Once on board the flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. They attached the baby cot to the divider, my 2 older children, 6 & 3, saw the baby pack and wanted the blankets as they came with penguins (didn’t say anything, they just poured!) and they were more than happy to supply these for them. The children’s food was a good selection of food they actually ate, we were checked on regularly and we found the flight more relaxing than we’d expected travelling with 3 small children!

Flight EK19 back to Manchester on 24th April 2019 not so good.

The father was sat on the aisle seat but made not 1 single attempt to control his daughter, he looked like everything was an effort (except eating the extra meals he asked for, and got) and instead put his headphones on/snoozed whilst his daughter roamed about (in between asking staff for things out of sequence instead of waiting to be served like the rest of us). Was disappointed with the lack of staff response, it ruined our flight. The man had an air of entitlement for some reason, even though his family had 3 seats so, in a way, us families next to him with 4 seats had paid more to be there yet got a worse service (I know it doesn't work like that but it is annoying when 1 passenger thinks they are above everyone else). To make it worse a man had been moved from his rightful seat to accommodate the family in those seats (they had missed their earlier flight so were put on this one instead), which was annoying in hindsight - we would all have had a nice flight in zone D if the original man seated there had not been forced to move.

631, Singapore to Edinburgh via Dubai. Was quite excited for this route but turns out to be a total nightmare and I would much rather stuck with my usual BA. The second leg of the flight from Dubai was delayed by 45 min. Plane was hot for the morning flight and cabin crew was rarely in sight for the entire 8 hours. Rarely had water or beverages offered. It felt like a budget flight. On the return flight ground staff had poor customer service. I wanted to buy an extra bag at the airport but they insisted on charging me overweight which amounted to £500 and resulting me in leaving my belongings in the UK. Inflight service was poor. Again cabin crew are rarely in sight. The second leg the snack was so dry I spat it out. Also not to mention no cabin crew was bringing out water for the flight. Overall an incredible letdown. Never flying this route again and Emirates isn’t worth the hype., Singapore to Edinburgh via Dubai.

632,"  Gatwick to Manila via Dubai. Was recommended by a colleague to fly Emirates business class. What I was surprised about was I experienced 2 very different business class products – I was totally shocked at the difference. London to Dubai was on an Airbus and Dubai to Manila a Boeing 777. The Airbus flight was aligned to business class travel expectations, seat was reasonably comfortable, large selection of IFE, food was of a good quality. My only quibbles were the seat belt length seemed quite short – it was tight on me and not something I experienced on other airlines; staff helped when asked but otherwise didn’t offer. The Boeing product is significantly inferior – uncomfortable seating and it was not lie flat, no storage at all, 2-3-2 configuration, no amenity kit etc, slow food service with a very limited selection. The Boeing flight is like flying premium economy – a good amount of leg room and a wider seat (seat belt size was much longer) but that’s as much as I can positively say about it. It was a really uncomfortable flight for me given it was close to 9 hours – I felt cheated for having paid for a business class seat. Regrettably, I had 2 more business class flights that week with Emirates which were not refundable otherwise I would have cancelled. Flew HKG to Dubai on an Boeing 777 - just as bad (if not worse) than the Manila flight. What storage existed was used by the cabin staff, myself and 2 other passengers had to store our cabin bags several rows behind us in a single overhead – we had to do this ourselves, no help or interest from cabin staff. Food was awful. Lounge in Dubai served excellent food and beverages and had some nice quiet seating areas. However, if you wanted some F&B getting it was a bit of a challenge - I witnessed only 2 serving stations for main courses and tea/coffee - despite being there for over an hour, never did manage to be able to get through the endless throng to get a cup of tea. I regularly travel long haul for business but I'm afraid Emirates does not get a recommendation from me.","  Gatwick to Manila via Dubai.

634,"  Brisbane to Dubai. I always thought Emirates was supposed to be one of the best but let me tell you, it is not. The staff were pretty professional but that is common among airlines. I was initially excited to be flying in an A380 for the first time but the moment I boarded, my heart sunk. It was obvious Emirates had chosen the the cheapest possible configuration that you would expect on a budget domestic airline. The seats were super low quality and grubby. There was next to no padding which made it painful for a 14 hour flight. The air was dry, but worse is the LED lighting which has a low Hz flicker. This becomes migraine inducing as the lighting splits into green blue and red as you move your eyes about. There is also an insufficient number of toilets available.

636," Probably the worst flight I ever had with EK since I started flying with them 13 years ago. My route was DXB-CAI and return both ways were with very old outdated B777. First of all EK stopped handing hot towels prior to take off, inflight magazines are removed from the seat pocket probably to reduce cost. On the way DXB-CAI we boarded on time however there was a delay of 1 full hour sitting on board with no explanation. Crew didn’t even bother to serve water or a juice and no explanation from the captain, secondly my headphones were not working properly due to the age of the aircraft and I had to keep holding it. Seat was broken and always reclining however I informed the crew but nothing happened, they kept asking me to adjust my seat to up position and I kept telling them it was broken. On the way back it was the opposite, it wouldn’t recline at all. The food service also has dropped a lot with the quality of the meal service and the portions which have become similar to what you get on a Low cost. When arrived back to Dubai also 30 mins late the luggage was delayed for more than an hour, they announced on the speakers but no explanation which led to being late for my early morning meeting as was supposed to land at 7:10am and had meeting at 9:30 am but I had to cancel it and of course no explanation or visibility of EK staff.

The seats on Boeing 777-300ER were extremely uncomfortable, the legroom was very tight and the seat width was also very cramped. Shortly after boarding completed, the cabin lights were switched off with on the screens and seat belt signs providing any light. The captain announced that we would be delayed due to heavy traffic along our flight path. No cabin crew were around to answer any queries and any calls for them were ignored. We eventually left Dubai over an hour late. The rest of the flight was unremarkable. The crew were not very friendly and didn't seem too bothered. The breakfast was ok but again the portion size was very small. After landing the I noticed that most of the cabin crew seemed absent with only one stewardess standing by the door.

643," I expected something more from Emirates. I've heard many pros about the airline from my friends who have flown with Emirates and an ex-Emirates stewardess. What I experienced, is the opposite of what they told me. They told me that the food is the best food you can eat in economy class. I have also read that the ICE intertainment system is the best IFE system in the world. I do not agree at all. My first flight was from Oslo to Dubai, flight number EK 160. We flew with a Boeing 777, reg A6-EWC. I was excited to try the ICE, so the first thing I did after I found my seat was to try the system. I was very disappointed when I realized, that the screen's temperature is over 40 degrees, and the touch works badly. The sound from the headphones was also very noisy, I think that DACs in the aircraft were maybe broken. I ordered Asian Vegetarian meal (AVML) on their website before the flight. Agian, I expected something more from a 4 star airline like Emirates. The food was just OK, nothing more than that. The next flight was from Dubai to Singapore with an A380, reg A6-EOT. The A380 was the best long haul plane I have flown with. There was a lot of legroom, and place next to the seat (I had a window seat) to leave small things like a pillow or your headsets. This time, the ICE worked well, and was more advanced than the old crap in the 777. Unfortunately, the cabin crew were rude and they didn't care about the passengers as much as the cabin crew in KLM or even AirAsia. I saw them only when twice when they gave food to the pax. On the way back to Oslo, I ordered Vegetarian meal. I was shocked, when they came with a Vegan meal. Is it so hard to see the difference? All other airlines offer vegeterian food or even lacto-ovo vegetarian etc. Also, I don't recommend the meal for those who are Vegans. It was really disgusting, and it was too warm. I will never recommend this airline to anybody. I could fly cheaper with airlines like Qatar Airways, LOT or Finnair, but I bought an Emirates ticket just for the A80."," I expected something more from Emirates.

644,"  Beirut to Colombo via Dubai. The flights were comfortable both ways and Emirates staff on board were helpful and friendly but on our way back from Colombo to Dubai we had a short layover and our first flight was delayed and then parked miles from the terminal, necessitating a long bus ride and meaning that we rushed to make our connection. When we arrived at our gate we enquired if our bags would make the connection and were told that they were in the process of being transferred. Our flights was then delayed by the gate for 30 minutes, leaving plenty of time for the bags to be loaded. Despite this, when we arrived in Beirut, we received a message to say our luggage wasn't on the plane and would arrive on the next flight, eight hours later. We were told by ground staff that it could not be delivered and we would have to return to the airport to collect it. It took us almost an hour to find the Emirates office and someone who would help us. He promised that if we returned that evening to collect the bags the office would be open and Emirates staff would help us and would reimburse our taxi costs. When we got back, the office was closed and locked and no one answered the phone. We tried going back three times over the course of an hour. No one was there. Eventually we got our bags but the process meant we lost almost four hours of our day and over $30 in additional taxi costs. Finally, as we were leaving the airport, Emirates staff called us to say that they were at baggage claim, though we had already been there to get our bags and seen no sign of them. When we explained that we had already left the airport, they told us to come back, despite the fact that we had already lost all the money on the extra taxis, not to mention our one free day back at home to prepare before going back to work. Terrible customer service from the Emirates staff in Beirut and no offer to reimburse our expenses or compensate for their mismanagement of the situation.","  Beirut to Colombo via Dubai.

648,"  Chicago to Dubai. First time flying Emirates business class and was excited to try it but very disappointed after my experience. No greeting by any of the staff even the check in staff. I got the middle seat and felt very claustrophobic. If you are also going as a couple or with a friend, it’s hard to carry a conversation with the person you are flying next to since the divider in between doesn’t even go down completely. On a long plane ride, this is very frustrating that you cannot even carry a proper conversation or see the person next to you. In terms of the service, the stewardess serving me was lazy and made me hand her all the trays and hand myself all the plates rather than setting it down directly on the table. I thought this is very unsafe since some dishes are very hot. She was also too lazy to make the bed for me so I had to do it myself. Not only that but one of the stewardesses left the tray on the seat in front of us which crashing down in front of my boyfriends feet during the middle of the flight. The head flight attendant walking by noticed it and didn’t even apologize and rather asked us abruptly what had happened like it was our fault his staff left the tray there. There are also no slippers or pajamas offered like other flights. The food is also not personalized and not very good. They didn’t even offer us dessert and when we asked for it, they assumed someone had already taken our order and didn’t give us the dessert. Most of all, the airport lounge in Dubai on the way to another city is really outdated, basic and unimpressive. It’s really long and big but composed of the same basic food drinks and no amenities other than a few shower rooms. The spa which was on the map was closed and half the loung was also closed when we were there for no reasons given. All the other major airlines business class I had taken including cathay, Singapore airlines, korean air and Etihad had much better lounges. I especially expected more since Emirates is Dubai’s flagship carrier but it looks like they cut costs severely. Would not take Emirates again although I already bought several more tickets for the rest of the leg of this trip that I cannot cancel. Some positives were chauffeur service, private entrance at gate for customs and security check in the Dubai airport, and the entertainment system on the plane which had a lot of movies. However the WiFi was very slow,  overall very disappointed.","  Chicago to Dubai. First time flying Emirates business class and was excited to try it but very disappointed after my experience.

650," I and my husband are 71 years old, flying regularly twice a year for many years and this flight was our worst flying experience ever! This flight was 6 hours long and we purchased the tickets with Emirates based on their advertising and did not mind paying almost double price than all the other companies charge. We wanted on this pretty long flight more comfort, wider seats, more legroom, good food and overall better experience as Emirates advertise. The outbound flight was with Emirates partner company FLy Dubai, Boeing 737Max not Airbus 380 as they advertise. Nothing of the advertisement was true. The airplane had regular narrow seats and little legroom and there was no complimentary drinks and food at all. This is almost criminal! Yes, you could buy drinks and food but why you pay almost double price to fly with this company? Their advertisement is fraudulent. On this journey we also flew from Abu Dhabi to Muscat with Oman Air. The flight was only 60 min. long and complimentary drinks and luncheon was served. Than we flew from Muscat back to Dubai with Swiss Air. On this only 50 min. long flight complimentary water and snack was served. The inbound flight with Emirates was not bad, Airbus 380, little wider seats and little more legroom, complimentary drinks and food. Nothing really great but OK. I complained to Emirates about our outbound flight without any successful result. They wrote me that their partner company should have same standards and that they are looking forward to see me on board again. I felt offended! I would never fly with Emirates again."," I and my husband are 71 years old, flying regularly twice a year for many years and this flight was our worst flying experience ever!

653,"  Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. Flight entertainment out of this world and the food was amazing. I love the look in the aircraft as well. Cabin service was good but ground service was terrible especially in Gatwick Airport. Staff were unfriendly and not helpful at all. Another thing is that the inconvenient online booking system of Emirates. we are a family of 4, 1 of us must be booked separately because of extra baggage weight which lead to we cannot check in together. Furthermore, we successfully checked in online for the first 3 of us but another family member with the separated booking cannot check in online due to overbooked flight. Therefore, we went to the counter to check in and they gave us 4 new seats, including the other 3 of us who checked in online earlier with already selected seats. Also we got new seats without being informed. Also almost all the seats are taken during 47 hours before departure for our return flights, I wonder why. In overall, I would still recommend flying with Emirates because of the inflight entertainment system, and in flight comfortably not to mention the A380.","  Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai.

Another thing is that the inconvenient online booking system of Emirates. we are a family of 4, 1 of us must be booked separately because of extra baggage weight which lead to we cannot check in together. Furthermore, we successfully checked in online for the first 3 of us but another family member with the separated booking cannot check in online due to overbooked flight. Therefore, we went to the counter to check in and they gave us 4 new seats, including the other 3 of us who checked in online earlier with already selected seats. Also we got new seats without being informed. Also almost all the seats are taken during 47 hours before departure for our return flights, I wonder why. In overall, I would still recommend flying with Emirates because of the inflight entertainment system, and in flight comfortably not to mention the A380.","[('Kuala', 'n'), ('Lumpur', 'n'), ('London', 'n'), ('via', None), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Flight', 'n'), ('entertainment', 'n'), ('world', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('amazing', 'v'), ('.', None), ('love', 'v'), ('look', 'n'), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('well', 'r'), ('.', None), ('Cabin', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('good', 'a'), ('ground', 'a'), ('service', 'n'), ('terrible', 'a'), ('especially', 'r'), ('Gatwick', 'n'), ('Airport', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Staff', 'n'), ('unfriendly', 'r'), ('helpful', 'v'), ('.', None), ('Another', None), ('thing', 'n'), ('inconvenient', 'a'), ('online', 'n'), ('booking', 'v'), ('system', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('.', None), ('family', 'n'), ('4', None), (',', None), ('1', None), ('us', None), ('must', None), ('booked', 'v'), ('separately', 'r'), ('extra', 'a'), ('baggage', 'n'), ('weight', 'v'), ('lead', 'v'), ('check', 'v'), ('together', 'r'), ('.', None), ('Furthermore', 'r'), (',', None), ('successfully', 'r'), ('checked', 'v'), ('online', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('3', None), ('us', None), ('another', None), ('family', 'n'), ('member', 'n'), ('separated', 'a'), ('booking', 'n'), ('check', 'v'), ('online', 'n'), ('due', 'a'), ('overbooked', 'a'), ('flight', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Therefore', 'r'), (',', None), ('went', 'v'), ('counter', 'n'), ('check', 'v'), ('gave', 'v'), ('us', None), ('4', None), ('new', 'a'), ('seats', 'n'), (',', None), ('including', 'v'), ('3', None), ('us', None), ('checked', 'v'), ('online', 'n'), ('earlier', 'r'), ('already', 'r'), ('selected', 'v'), ('seats', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Also', 'r'), ('got', 'v'), ('new', 'a'), ('seats', 'n'), ('without', None), ('informed', 'v'), ('.', None), ('Also', 'r'), ('almost', 'r'), ('seats', 'n'), ('taken', 'v'), ('47', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('departure', 'n'), ('return', 'n'), ('flights', 'n'), (',', None), ('wonder', 'v'), ('.', None), ('overall', 'a'), (',', None), ('would', None), ('still', 'r'), ('recommend', 'v'), ('flying', 'v'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('inflight', 'a'), ('entertainment', 'n'), ('system', 'n'), (',', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('comfortably', 'r'), ('mention', 'v'), ('A380', 'n'), ('.', None)]","  Kuala Lumpur London via Dubai .

We were met at the airport and handed (no discussion) a ticket for the next flight (next day 24 hours away) and a hotel voucher. No Emirates agents were at the hotel nor were there any agents at the airport that could answer any question about upgrading or compensation. No one knew anything about anything. Unbelievable.

656,"  My wife was travelling from Birmingham to Delhi return via Dubai. While she was on her way back to the UK she experienced the worst service from Dubai airport ground staff. My wife was carrying our daughter (1 year) on her lap and strolling a cabin back with one hand, a backpack on her back and holding a personal bag in her second hand. She was coming from India and it was late night flight from India. She saw a cart at the airport with 2-3 ground staff members sitting in it. She asked them to help her but they said no. How could you do that to a mother of a toddler? The 2nd incident happened to me when I was flying along-with my wife and daughter. The flight was late so they ended up rushing all the passengers to the plane in no time. Then to my surprise although I was standing and carrying my daughter on the lap; the plane started taxiing.

663,"  Sydney to Kathmandu via Dubai. Never fly in their partnership flights We love Emirates. We fly with them even if it is few hundred dollars expensive or a couple of hours longer journey. Appreciate lovely crews, wifi, comfortable seats and food. However, I found that their connection and transit service is worst (cannot compare with any other airport standard) at Dubai and they don’t respect passengers flying with them in partnership arrangements.  Emirates took off 25 min late from SYD. It took additional 20 min to reach to gate at Dubai. Almost 45 min late. Hardly 1 Hr and a bit left for my next flight to KTM. As there was no one waiting at the plane gate, I rushed to Emirates connection centre at Dubai. The response I got there was very upsetting. They were not helping me because my other flight was with flyDubai (which I did not notice earlier as I booked this thru Emirates). Gate number of my flight was not displayed in the Boards. No one helped me, they asked me to wait the gate number to be displayed, which never did. I missed the flight, because the Emirates was late and their information system was not good. They did not bother to help us because we were only 3 passengers in this connection. The following flyDubai flight to KTM was over-booked, so we had to wait next Oman Air flight via Mascot. I reached KTM approx. 18 hrs late to find another surprise. My little suitcase was broken. I made a complain at Sydney and claimed for missing goods. Emirates responded to me in 7 days as - “it is the airline industry policy and agreement between airlines. Oman Air has a direct responsibility to resolve your claim.. suggest that you contact Oman Air.” I was expecting something better than this from Emirates Airlines. My advice, never fly in their partnership flights, avoid Dubai airport connection if possible.","  Sydney to Kathmandu via Dubai. Never fly in their partnership flights We love Emirates.

669,"  This was the worse airline experience I’ve had. London to Dammam via Dubai, I had to stop over in Dubai for a couple of days for a family matter (I’m a GCC citizen so I don’t need a visa to Dubai). On the Emirates disk in LHR, I requested to have my luggage checked into DXB but I was told that I can’t do this because my ticket doesn’t allow a stop over unless I pay an upgrade of 2000 US Dollars or I can request my luggage once I arrived to DXB and I will be able to take them so this is what I did. When I arrived to DXB, I requested my luggage to be off the airplane and was told to wait for 2 hours to be able to collect my luggage. But when I came back to them after 2 hours they told me that the luggage are taken out of the aircraft but I can not take them unless I pay the 2000 Dollars, I tried to explain to them that I had to end my trip in Dubai and I need my stuff and my medicines from the bags but they refused.

674,"  Vienna to Cape Town via Dubai. This review is about my outbound flight to Cape Town (December 19th 2018). My children and I were denied boarding our flight to South Africa due to not having their birth certificates upon check-in, even though the South African government updated the policy December 1st 2018 (which no longer requires this document as mandatory). Not only did Emirate not indicate at any time during the booking process about this law they refused to reason when I showed them South African's government recent update. Due to the busy Christmas season, we were unable to fly to South African until 3 days later, missed the cruise we were to join and had to embark the ship in Namibia 6 days after the original travel date. We were meant to meet my husband on board the ship and missed out on Christmas because of this mistake. The kids were devastated. We were over EUR€4,500 out of pocket since I had to book hotels, new flights and transfers, all because they hadn't updated their policies. Their customer service department is a joke as the only way I could submit a complaint was through their website online form. Their response (claiming zero responsibility and therefore denying me any compensation) was from a ""no-reply"" email address. Even after I spoke with a customer service rep over the phone I was instructed to submit a new complaint since I couldn't follow up to their response email. I submitted a new complaint, correcting their false claims (that I didn't have a travel letter from my husband, which I did have) and I haven't heard back. My husband and I have been working in the travel & hospitality industry for 25+ years and I am extremely knowledgable in luxury customer service; this is what I do for a living. This by far is the worst I have ever experienced. I will never fly Emirates again. Oh and 4/5 checked in luggage was left behind on our return flight. We received them 2 days later.","  Vienna to Cape Town via Dubai. This review is about my outbound flight to Cape Town (December 19th 2018).

Paid for a extra room seat at Door 3, 24 D being an aisle on the B777. Flight was very full with many children and to their credit two of the crew were very engaging with them and their parents. What I do not get is why Emirates insist on placing ten across high density on all their B777 aircraft - an industry norm these days but it begs belief. As the crew went up and down the aisle I was knocked into over 12 times in less than an hour and I am 78 Kg, some at least had the courtesy to apologize, most did not bother. I get its cattle class but I for one would never set foot on these aircraft in this high density. I find EK crew to be stoic, tired looking, the crew member at my door crew seat looked as if he dying for his bed, head in his hands, yawned non stop and a lot of the crew looked plain disinterested. This is obviously down to crew planning being over stretched. Overall ok, flight deck did a great job with announcements and the flight itself and landing was excellent - true skill. Would not fly long haul based on this, you see a totally different service and staff attitude between J and Y class. Engaged to must I do the basics."," Dubai to Bahrain.

681,"  I travelled from Manchester to Faisalabad vi. Dubai, and from Manchester to Dubai the service was good. But from Dubai to Faisalabad, Emirates use the service provided by Flydubai, whose service is of a very poor quality. When providing a 'meal' it was just a small snack and when I asked about a hot drink such as a cup of tea, I was told to pay 20 dirhams (roughly £4.21 each), and soft drinks were roughly 5 dirhams (£1.05). I had 3 family members travelling with me (including my elderly parents), we paid over £2000 for tickets alone, and on top of that we were asked for outrageous prices for a service which should be covered by the ticket prices anyway. I contacted Emirates to complain and the email I received in reply was written in a way as though I were at fault, stating things such as ""this is the service we will contnue to provide"" and that I should contact my agent as they should have told me about these extra charges. However, on their booking it says 'meal provided' on both Emirates service and flydubai's service which would suggest that a reasonable meal is given, when in fact it was simply a small snack. A few days later a friend of mine returned from Faisalabad and Emirates were using the same service and the flight was delayed causing the airline to provide a hotel room. The shocking thing was he was told he would have to share a hotel room with complete strangers. No company has a right to do this as it is an invasion of privacy and is extremely invasive. It is clear that Emirates no longer have the same standard of service and I would not use this service again myself, nor recommend it to anyone else in the future.","  I travelled from Manchester to Faisalabad vi.

The big let down was that the crew did not offer or serve any desserts and even refused to provide a second round of drinks.","[('Dubai', 'n'), ('Delhi', 'n'), ('.', None), ('journey', 'n'), ('started', 'v'), ('hotel', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('provides', 'v'), ('complimentary', 'a'), ('chauffeur', 'n'), ('drive', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('.', None), ('chauffeur', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), (',', None), ('priority', 'n'), ('check-in', 'n'), ('lounge', 'n'), ('exceptional', 'a'), ('.', None), ('ground', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('helped', 'v'), ('us', None), ('navigate', 'v'), ('way', 'n'), ('airport', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Boarding', 'n'), ('smooth', 'v'), (',', None), ('plane', 'n'), ('old', 'a'), ('however', 'r'), (',', None), ('clean', 'a'), ('interiors', 'n'), ('.', None), ('inflight', 'a'), ('service', 'n'), ('mark', 'n'), ('.', None), ('crew', 'n'), (""n't"", 'r'), ('courteous', 'a'), ('meet', 'v'), ('expectations', 'n'), ('business', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('.', None), ('big', 'a'), ('let', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('offer', 'v'), ('serve', 'v'), ('desserts', 'n'), ('even', 'r'), ('refused', 'v'), ('provide', 'v'), ('second', 'a'), ('round', 'n'), ('drinks', 'n'), ('.', None)]","  Dubai Delhi . journey start hotel airport .

690," Munich to Riyadh via Dubai. Both aircraft were in excellent condition, both from a maintenance and cleanliness point of view. The crew is friendly and offers a punctual and reliable service. The seats are exceptionally comfortable and guarantee very high privacy: there is plenty of space for the legs and for hand luggage and the division between the seats allows extra comfort. The Wi-Fi is free for every Skywards member. Since the registration to the program is also free, the service is very good. It is not the fastest one, but definitely with the best value for money. There is plenty of choice regarding entertainment. The ground service is exceptional: I forgot one bag on the plane and during the layover between the other connection the staff was able to retrieve my baggage and bring it to the lounge in time for the next flight.

691,"  Amsterdam to Cape Town via Dubai. As a very frequent emirates passenger in the past, we have nor used the economy Emirates product for over 4 years. Check in was laborious as a they were checking everyone’s visas which is understandable. Boarding was good. No issues both in AMS or DXB. Onboard service is now a huge let down. On both sectors after take off it took 2 hours before the food service was started. And at no point was a bar service offered. Not just alcohol beverages but water or soft drinks. The food was below average and it was only after the food was eaten the bar service came out. I can on Y assume that Emirates is trying to cut back and save money. But what they don’t realise is the majority of there traffic is in Economy and if you keep cutting the service then people will stop booking. Especially when the completion like Qatar or Etihad offer better service on the same routes. We will not be booking with Emirates economy in the near future as it is not a pleasurable experience anymore. Also I felt the ICE was of a reduced choice as compared to a few years ago. Sorry Emirates but you are living on previous accolades.","  Amsterdam to Cape Town via Dubai.

692,  Madrid to Sydney via Dubai. This is a review that is a follow up on my outbound. The reviews are almost identical. Great hard product but the soft product on Emirates is just simply lacking and its down to the crews who are at best very lackadaisical. You have a few who are superb but on the whole it reflects a training problem. Much noise and chat going on which is very annoying during the night routes. One thing I have never seen and clearly much revelry goes on in the Emirates dorms. One female FA groped the boob of another in a playful manner. Now for red hot blooded males this may be fine but sorry this is a major flag carrier. Whilst on the Emirates gripe. The IFE is fine but to be honest was struggling too find some films that really appealed. Emirates caters for a huge language base. Final gripe. The seat quality certainly in economy is dire. The cushioning is hard or maybe has been so well used that it is worn. Come on Emirates. A one time leader has slipped into the pack with a terrible soft product.,  Madrid to Sydney via Dubai.

693,"  Sydney to Madrid via Dubai. Being a Qantas FF I occasionally travel on Emirates but with a Qantas code on it. Now same aircraft (A380) but the whole experience is totally different. Have been on Emirates a few times a year mostly when routing to a Europe port other than London. Sydney being the Qantas home base is these days very efficient to get through. Self check in (even though i can use the First counter) and through security and to the Qantas lounge in probably 15 minutes. The Emirates version is very different and rightly so as it is not home base. The economy line up was massive. Fortunately could use the premium line and was through swiftly. Time for Emirates to start using self check in. Used the superb Qantas First Lounge and then moved over to the Emirates lounge which was a very pleasant place. From there the whole experience was pretty dismal. Had a whole row to myself in the main cabin which was great. Same sights and sounds as for the Qantas A380 but its the customer service that lets Emirates down. They just simply have recruited too many young kids who just dont have the professionalism or charm of the slightly older crews on Qantas main line. Its really a training problem. Having crew that speak 30 languages on board is fine but does not help if their manner is to put it mildly rather brusque. Charm school is sorely missing. Mid flight snacks are poor to non existent. Food is a little underwhelming. Delayed start from Sydney due to bad weather and a tight connection meant a run through Dubai T3 to get to the Madrid flight. Same plane, different crew but same lack of charm and professionalism. And Emirates...one other thing. Please do not have your crews take away blankets, act as general cleaners and so on around 30 minutes before landing. It jut is not a great look. Overall the airline needs to employ proper training methods or better still get some older crew who can teach the young ones how to. The fact is that Emirates gets away with sloppy standards since they have a great network, hard product in the A380, great airport in Dubai. For me it is the easiest way to get to Madrid from Sydney so have to get used to a substandard level of service which many people have commented on. I would recommend Emirates only as it has the route network and schedules. Bit short on other alternatives at that price point.","  Sydney to Madrid via Dubai.

Their customer services explained to me that I will only need to book a one way flight from Europe to Dubai as my return flight, which was already booked, will remain valid. However, one day before the date of my return flight back to Europe, I found out that my ticket had been cancelled due to “no show”, despite being told previously that I will be able to use my return flight.

However, one day before the date of my return flight back to Europe, I found out that my ticket had been cancelled due to “no show”, despite being told previously that I will be able to use my return flight. In addition to that, the complaint has been handled extremely poorly, with a complete lack of consideration, by Emirates customer services who repeatedly refused to transfer me to a manager for an official complaint.

Now, at the end of January I called to redeem my voucher for a flight on August 19th, returning to Sydney 15th. As Emirates have changed their schedule they now refuse to honour the voucher. They have available seats on Qantas code share from Sydney but flatly refuse to accept their own voucher. Emirates did infer that they may be able to offer a Jetstar code share out of Melbourne. This is completely unacceptable. I note that Emirates are cutting back flights to Australia.

During Online process I realized there is no more windows seats available. During checkin on the airport I've asked to window seat and I got this seat in emergency row. Also my baggage has been sent without extra costs (I had extra 6kg). At the terminal I've paid to lounge contracted with Emirates airline but it wasn't worth this price (250 DKK, around 33EUR). Boarding at the gate was late around 30 minutes but during this process there was good order, people was queued in the groups. Service on board was good but nothing special comparing to other airlines, meal choice was poor (only dishes with rice). Very good and very stable entertainment system with big selection of movies and games. Also GSM and WIFI network available onboard (I didn't use them at all due to nice passengers travelling next to me, we talked all the time). I land around midnight so traffic wasn't big and all security and luggage pickup in Dubai takes not much (around 1 hour). My flight back to Warsaw was 2 two days later at 8:05. I tried to check-in to choose my seat but it wasn't possible. During my way to the airport I've got an SMS with info I had been seated in the middle. So I went to the airport around 3:30AM and very quickly drop my luggage and pass all security to avoid waiting. It wasn't possible to change my seat, however they seat me in emergency row again. Unfortunately I had been charged for an extra 6 kilos in luggage. Security control was terrible long, they try to find something in my bag but they didn't tell me what they are looking for. I was more clever than on my previous flight and I've put all my cables in checked luggage before to avoid cables confiscated like on my previous flight. I don't understand why ethernet cable is dangerous at Dubai airport but it's ok on all other airports around the world. Inside the airport I found hundreds of people seating and lying on the floor and making passing very difficult in some areas. Whole airport was looking like dormitory for the homeless. Wifi I found overloaded, there was many disconnections during my use. During boarding there was a big mess, airport staff didn't queue people in groups before they start, boarding started 15 minutes after scheduled time. Flight was operated by Boeing 777 and I found seats are more tight than in A380. This travel was terribly uncomfortable. Also I found all meals are with potatoes on this flight (again no choice) and service good but average. All cabin staff on both flights tried to be nice. I arrive very tired. In Warsaw Emirates was 15 minutes late and they passed my luggage to next operator without any problems.","  Due to my business trip I had to travel from Copenhagen Kastrup airport to Dubai and then back to Warsaw to catch my next flight from there. So first part of trip was operated by A380. During Online process I realized there is no more windows seats available. During checkin on the airport I've asked to window seat and I got this seat in emergency row. Also my baggage has been sent without extra costs (I had extra 6kg). At the terminal I've paid to lounge contracted with Emirates airline but it wasn't worth this price (250 DKK, around 33EUR). Boarding at the gate was late around 30 minutes but during this process there was good order, people was queued in the groups.

713," It was my first time travelling on Emirates Airlines. Flew from Singapore to Dubai with my family of 4. The ICE entertainment system could not be loaded for us and at least another 5 to 6 rows of passengers in the center row for the entire flight of more than 7 hours. We thought we paid for a premium airline but got a budget flight experience instead. The air crew could not care less; there was just an announcement on board that the in-flight entertainment for some passengers cannot be re-started. Two attempts to get the attention of the air stewardesses through the help button for a separate matter were ignored and not responded to at all. It has been two weeks, and Emirates has not responded to my feedback. I usually travel with Asian airlines, which really compares way better in terms of hospitality, in-flight service and facilities."," It was my first time travelling on Emirates Airlines.

We discussed with the inflight staff and asked them if they can spare some meat from the business class meals and the flight attended said that that was not possible. When we landed in Cyprus we asked to talk to the flight purser and she said she will see what she can do, Once we left Larnaka-Cyprus to Dubai, we asked if the crew managed to solve the issue, but they said unfortunately not and there was nothing they can do, they said that they informed Dubai so they can prepare food for the next flight, again I was left hungry on the flight between Larnaka-Cyprus and Dubai. My Father offered to pay extra for the business class food, but the staff said no. When we landed in Dubai, the first thing we done was to go to customer help and information desk and asked if the crew have ordered any Gluten free food for the next flight from Dubai to Male, the desk assistant said that there was nothing on the system and she will try and get some gluten free food on-board the next flight but she said she cannot promise.  We boarded the flight from Dubai to Male to Maldives and when dinner time arrived they informed us that there was no Gluten free meals and that there was only 3 meals available for other guests which they pre-ordered.

722,"  Sydney to Athens via Dubai. My husband and I have flown to Europe previously with Etihad, Qatar, and this year, Emirates. To say Emirates was disappointing and a league behind Etihad and Qatar would be an understatement. Our itinerary was to fly to Athens with Emirates, stay a night in Athens and then fly to Santorini with a different airline the following morning. Upon bag drop in Sydney with Emirates, we were asked if we would like our bags checked all the way through to Santorini. We stated that we had a night in Athens and were flying a different airline to Santorini; however, were reassured that this wasn't a problem at all and we could easily check our bags all the way through. So, for ease, time and convenience, we did; as we trusted that Emirates knew what they were doing. However, upon check in at Athens airport for our flight to Santorini, we were told by our airline that our bags would not have been checked through and we had to go and find them at baggage claim. With baggage claim struggling to locate our bags at baggage claim, we ended up missing our 9am flight to Santorini. As a direct result of us missing the flight, we then had to pay 450 euro for new flights to Santorini (one way for two people ; an equivalent of over $800 AUD), with the new flight scheduled for 5pm. As a direct result of Emirates incompetence, we not only missed our flight, but missed an entire day in Santorini. The anxiety caused from not knowing where our bags were, no one being able to help us, missing our flight, not being able to get onto another flight for another 8 hours, paying 450 euro for new flights, re-scheduling our hotel transfer and dinner booking (meaning that we could not get into the restaurant until 10pm) and having to re-purchase 40 euro train tickets back to Athens caused me to have an anxiety attack in the airport.  The most disappointing part is that Emirates were so difficult to deal with after the incident. We had to wait months to hear back from Emirates if our new flights to Santorini would be paid for; and that was the only compensation they gave. Emirates would not pay for any of my medical bills, our new train tickets or any compensation for our flights to/from Europe despite them causing havoc to our trip. As a result, I would strongly urge people not to fly with Emirates due to their level of incompetence, lack of professionalism and lack of empathy. ","  Sydney to Athens via Dubai.

724,"  I travelled with my family from Dubai to Mauritius and what I did not like was the conduct of the staff near the end of the flight. The flight attendant came and collected the blankets 45 minutes before the landing and she did that in a firm way, like there was no discussion. I gave her mine (even though I am very cold whenever an AC is on) and had to ask her to let my daughter keep it. She said yes in a way like she was doing a favour to me. Then the lady next seat told her that she needed to keep the blanket, because she was sick and the flight attendant had a back and forth with her until she conceded at the end. Then after that, she came for the headphones 35 minutes before the landing with an almost rude attitude. My daughter and I were nearly finishing our movie and wanted to tell her that, but then I was watching around and no one was saying anything - I felt like I would be the only one complaining. I gave her both headphones and sat there for 30 minutes thinking about this flight. After all, leaving a blanket and a headphone for the passenger until the end of the flight is not asking too much. It's about the minimum an airline should provide for.","  I travelled with my family from Dubai to Mauritius and what I did not like was the conduct of the staff near the end of the flight.

726,"  Munich to Adelaide via Dubai. The first flight from Munich to Dubai was excellent. Traveling alone with my 10 month old son, the cabin crew were amazing. Introduced themselves personally and took my son for walks through the plane, gave him a meal & toys, and took a Polaroid keepsake. The flight wasnt full so I had the 4 seats to myself with the bassinet and when someone moved to the aisle seat after takeoff, Natasha said she would find the passenger an alternative seat for both our comfort levels (which was unnecessary but great). Unfortunately, the Dubai-Adelaide leg was terrible. I waited nearly 1.5 hours after takeoff to get the bassinet put up, then during the flight which was really turbulent (not much can be done about that I know), I had to buzz for my food trays to be removed as they sat there for a few hours. An elderly man was I'll in the toilet near where I was seated, and had opened the door whilst doubled over the sink vomiting, so again I buzzed for assistance for him but nobody even came! 2 female crew had an argument in the aisle about 1 getting a food order wrong, and it was just very unprofessional. Had it not been for the assistance of the passenger on the aisle and behind me helping me to reach the overhead compartment etc as i needed nappies and things during the flight, but had my son in my arms for almost 10 of the 12 hours due to the turbulence so was attempting to function using 1 hand, the flight would have been a worse experience. Food was ok (no infant meal provided) but ran out of salmon so only turkey available in 2nd meal service. Ticket was cheapest option for route but customer service needs a massive review for greater consistency across all flights.","  Munich to Adelaide via Dubai.

728,"  Brisbane to Nairobi via Dubai. My husband and I flew with Emirates for the first time and had negative experiences on both flights, there and back. The negative was in Dubai when we were waiting for our second flight. We were told boarding would start 40 minutes before departure and would close 20 minutes before departure. Approximately 50 minutes before departure was the first time the flight was shown on the departure screen with ""FINAL CALL"". We had to run to get to the gate on time as we thought we would miss our flight. When we arrived I asked why they started boarding so early and why there was no announcement for boarding until ""FINAL CALL"" and the hostess replied ""It's protocol"". We received no explicit reason or justification whatsoever. The second was in Nairobi. Their system was down which is understandable that queues were extremely long and service taking a long time as well. However, we received absolutely no announcements as to what was happening and when the flight would take off. We were meant to fly at 10:45pm. After boarding at approximately that time we sat on the plane at the gate for 3 hours until we finally took off at 1:45am the next morning. On that flight I pushed the service button for water as we weren't given anything for those 3 hours waiting on the plane but no one answered my request. I did this twice until I gave up. This wait and level of service was extremely frustrating to most passengers as they had connecting flights with short layovers. I was very disappointed with the service and lack of explanation by Emirates on this trip. I am not planning on flying with them again.","  Brisbane to Nairobi via Dubai.

737,"  London to Brisbane via Dubai. Our flight from London Heathrow was late, which resulted in us rushing through the transit to book in for the next connecting flight from Dubai to Brisbane (via Singapore). When we arrived at the Dubai check in, it was apparent that there was something wrong but the Emirates staff just talked amongst themselves. After some 15 or 20 other passengers checked in after us for the same flight (5 of them Business Class customers) the Emirates staff told us that they had changed our seats and we couldn't sit together, but they offered no reason for this, I told the staff that we had booked these seats and my partner was a nervous flyer so we could not sit in separate locations. They said you have no choice, I asked to be upgraded to 1st class, they refused, I offered to travel on the next flight 02.30hrs (some 5 hours later), I was abruptly told that our luggage was on the flight that we were originally booked on (21.15hrs) and we needed to board that flight as it was departing in a few minutes. Their attitude for Business Class customers (or any customer) was deplorable. We arrived at Brisbane, but our luggage didn't, the staff at Brisbane were helpful but couldn't tell us where it was, as it hadn't been 'scanned in' at Dubai. I then got access to text messages on my mobile phone, which I couldn't obtain whilst on the flights, for some reason, the text read 'due to operational reasons we have had to transfer you to the flight that departs from Dubai at 02.30hrs', why didn't the staff at Dubai know about this instead of refusing me travel on this service, especially when I had offered to do just that. We waited at Brisbane, for the next flight to arrive, but still no luggage. It took Emirates 3 days to get our luggage to us, by this time we had travelled to Cairns as this was how we had booked our holiday and accommodation. On our return flight to London, which departed from Melbourne, we checked in and the staff said 'due to the flight being full we have changed your seats', from Dubai to London. I couldn't understand why this would be necessary just because the flight was full, again I refused this and asked to be upgraded, no was the reply. We then had to wait at the customer service desk and they eventually explained that they had e mailed Dubai and we had got our original seats, although the staff pointed out to me that the seats were only a request and not guaranteed, I showed them an email from Emirates which confirmed the flight and seat details, from the outset of the booking. The Emirates customer service desk operative made a point that she had done us a favour, in getting our original seats back. When we arrived at Dubai check in, again we were faced with 'we have changed your seats'. I couldn't believe this and again had to wait and argue to get our original seats. The staff on the plane were very attentive and polite on all legs, but the staff on the ground just don't care, rude and not worthy of the Emirates uniform. I asked several times 'how much do you want me to pay before you start giving us some level of service' I have written to Emirates with the complaint and incredibly they have referred it to Qantas, because Emirates were only operating the flight on their behalf, how that works when it was the Emirates staff who caused the issues I don't know.","  London to Brisbane via Dubai.

We then had to wait at the customer service desk and they eventually explained that they had e mailed Dubai and we had got our original seats, although the staff pointed out to me that the seats were only a request and not guaranteed, I showed them an email from Emirates which confirmed the flight and seat details, from the outset of the booking. The Emirates customer service desk operative made a point that she had done us a favour, in getting our original seats back. When we arrived at Dubai check in, again we were faced with 'we have changed your seats'. I couldn't believe this and again had to wait and argue to get our original seats. The staff on the plane were very attentive and polite on all legs, but the staff on the ground just don't care, rude and not worthy of the Emirates uniform. I asked several times 'how much do you want me to pay before you start giving us some level of service' I have written to Emirates with the complaint and incredibly they have referred it to Qantas, because Emirates were only operating the flight on their behalf, how that works when it was the Emirates staff who caused the issues I don't know.","[('London', 'n'), ('Brisbane', 'n'), ('via', None),

739," Manchester to Singapore via Dubai. We flew Emirates on each leg of our trip to Singapore. The first leg on Sunday 25th November 2018 (Manchester -Dubai) was excellent, the crew were attentive and very pleasant. The next leg (Dubai-Singapore) was less pleasant the crew less attentive. The return flights (8th December)were much more unpleasant the aircraft was full on both legs but that should not have had any bearing on the complete lack of interest that the crew displayed. On the first leg my wife felt as though she was about to vomit, I went with her to the back of the plane and asked a member of the crew for some advice (He was chatting to two other crew members at the time) his response was to point to a toilet at the rear and said “Sick bags in the restroom” no other concern was expressed. The leg from Dubai to Manchester was over night leaving Dubai at 2.55am for at least three hours we saw no crew at all, anything we needed had to be requested by a visit to the curtained off galley. Overall we were extremely disappointed by the standard of service, far less than we expected. The uniforms of the crew are probably the smartest in the business but along with this must go an equivalent level of customer service. This was our first trip with Emirates but I expected far more from them than this. Good clean aircraft, food only so-so, good timekeeping but oh dear! The level of service fell far below what should be a standard."," Manchester to Singapore via Dubai. We flew Emirates on each leg of our trip to Singapore.

WiFi was not working on any flight. Finally was able to talk to someone and they gave us info on who to contact.

Initially wanted to keep my experience to myself but not after reading Skytrax reviews on Emirates. First and foremost, I was allotted the worst seat anyone can get. Seat 66H,  the lavatory seat. Wrote to Emirates 3 days back, I am in Dubai now, my flight is done, but no response from them. Luckily upon online check-in, I decided to change my ""aromatic"" seat - and I had to pay extra for a different seat. Emirates should not sell or make money from this row of seats. Esp when there are still empty seats on the flight for sale or seat change for extra payment. Its downright unacceptable and disgusting from a country that prides itself to be super rich operating the 2nd largest A380 fleet. I know now, I was fooled by all of Emirates advertisements and their perceived image. On to the flight, the flight was below expectation. Economy class cabin crews' attention and attitude got heaps to improve. Giving me the immediate impression that Emirates only crave and care for Business and First Class passengers attention, I guess Economy class passengers are only herds of cattle to them. The food was bland and presentation was poor. And the Emirates A380 economy seat is very uncomfortable Someone should remind Emirates management, that Economy class service ultimately differentiates an airline from its competitors and generates the most revenue for any airline Anyone wants to fly Emirates? fly Business or First, never Economy.","  Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai.

751,"  Newark to Athens. When we received the email from Emirates to check in we were offered an upgrade to Business for $600 per person.  We took it, thinking that we would be wowed by Emirates world class service, food and reputation. Read on. After checking in online we called to find out more about Emirates' car service, knowing we were outside the 50 mile radius we were willing to pay the difference. ""No' we were told, ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so you are not eligible"". Really? Even if we would pay for it? After we checked in at the airport we asked where the lounge was located. ""No"" we were told ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so that doesn't get lounge access"". Funny, didn't see mention of that when Emirates took my $1200. (we got into the lounge any way). Boarded an old 777-200. It was late (almost midnight). We had a nice cocktail and dinner and went to sleep. Forgot to put the sticker on my shirt and so 2 hours before landing, and in the middle of a nice deep sleep, was awoken by the FA who asked what I wanted for breakfast (even though he could see I was sound asleep). My husband was out like a light and the FA said ""I guess he doesn't want breakfast"". Astute observation. Before I went to sleep and after I woke up I tried to find something to watch on the IFE. Nothing. It was late so there was no question that we would be sleeping, but the seat was not full flat and the hard arm rests were hard to maneuver around. Overall I would say that I was glad we got to upgrade, but felt sorry for those folks who paid a lot more than we did for the same experience.","  Newark to Athens.

754,"  Dubai to Houston. I have never experienced such a complete & total lack of professionalism, by any airline. Travelers can encounter a problem on any airline, but it is how an airline handles a problem that is most important. This experience on EK was a ""case study in abject incompetence"". The flight was boarded on time, but departure time came & went, & passengers were left sitting, with zero flight deck contact for almost 1.5 hours before the 1st contact by The Captain. There had been a problem with a smoke detector in the crew's sleeping cabin, but it would soon be fixed & we would be ""on our way in about 15 minutes"". Yet again, we sat with no update k for over another hour, by which time the flight was 2.5 hours late. The Captain then made a 2nd announcement that it had taken longer to fix the problem than anticipated, but we would ""now depart in about 10-15 minutes"". However, for a 3rd time, passengers were left sitting another 1+ hour with no flight deck contact. What kind of flight crew training does EK provide, where a Captain thinks it is OK to let passengers sit in silence on a flight delayed 3+ hours, yet make only 2 incorrect announcements? After sitting for 3.5 hours the Captain direct all passengers to collect their belongings & deplane. So 100's of passengers deplane, but those in 1st & Business Class on the upper deck had another surprise waiting. Neither the Captain, or the flight crew had alerted ground staff that upper deck passengers had been directed to deplane. As a result, all 1st & Business Class passengers were crammed at the end of the jetway in front of the 2nd floor elevators, with no place to go! Passengers could enter the elevators, but security had disabled the floor selection buttons after the plane had originally boarded. Passengers started to bang on the glass walls to try & get the attention of security staff who could be seen in the distance, but unable to hear through the heavy glass walls. Passengers finally returned to the plane to tell the ""totally clueless"" flight crew, there was no place to go & passengers were trapped in the small  2nd floor area. Security personnel finally noticed passengers banging on the wall & 1 unlocked a 5th floor door & came to the 2nd level via stairwell, since they also could not operate the elevators. This employee then directed all 1st & Business Class passengers to carry all their belongings up 6 flights to the 5th floor Business Class Lounge! What a fiasco of total incompetence. The flight ended up being 5.5 hours late, but once airborne, passengers quickly learned that even though the plane had sat at the gate for almost 6 hours, it had not been re-catered, so the flight was serving a ""breakfast"" menu, even though the flight departed at almost 4:00PM. No dinner would be served, but rather a light snack, since the menu was still for the ""original"" flight times.

755," I traveled from Trivandrum to Dallas via Dubai to visit my 94 year old dad who was in critical condition in the hospital. However, he passed away the night before my flight. I was forced to change my return from November 14 to November 8 as my dad's funeral was on November 5. I had a 20 hour layover in Dubai on my return and Emirates was to provide me hotel and meals in Dubai on my scheduled return date of November 14. However, even though I used the exact same flight combination for my return from TVM to Dubai and Dubai to DFW on November 8, Emirates refused to provide me hotel and meals at Dubai. I had to pay an extra $85 for hotel and approximately $50 for meals. As it is, I paid $1,609.54 originally for the ticket which I thought was overpriced and an additional $375 in penalties and fare difference for changing my return date. I am left wondering whether Emirates is in the business of providing air transportation or of highway robbery. I have traveled on Emirates previously and I definitely got the feeling that not only are they nickel and diming their passengers but their cabin and ground crew at DFW service are much worse than before."," I traveled from Trivandrum to Dallas via Dubai to visit my 94 year old dad who was in critical condition in the hospital.

Odessa to Hanoi via Dubai. I had a very bad experience with Emirates. On 3rd July, 2018 my wife and I took a return flight from Odessa (ODS) to Hanoi ((HAN) via Dubai (DXB); After checked-in, We have waited in long time over boarding time, and then a lady likes a Representative of EK appeared and made a contact with passengers in lounge to announce that flight was delayed more. And in long time waiting that lady appeared again to notice that the incoming flight from DXB landed in Kishinev (Moldova)- KIV and then flew back at ODS in a couple time. We and passengers on this flight have continued to wait. Nearly 02 hours later the lady informed that the incoming flight would flight back to ODS, but crews were over duty time then there would be no outgoing flight to DXB from ODS, it means flight today cancelled. The alternative flight ODS-DXB would be on next day morning, but she didn’t know when! How should I do when I was sure that We missed connecting flight from DXB to HAN? I showed our tickets, mentioned her that our connection flight to Hanoi and asked her what solution would be done for us. I received an answer from her: “I cannot do anything here because there is no computer, no system. I have only telephone!” Even She didn't care on my connection ticket. And she informed that Passenger were provided meals and hotel for that night and would take flight on next day but she didn’t know when! Emirates representative at ODS airport didn’t offer me any alternative protected trip except meals an hotel for that night! No answer, no choice offered by Emirates for me. It’s was terrible and truly that Emirates have set own passengers like me and my wife aside and had no care. Fortunately, there was an flight from ODS to HAN later at 09:30PM by Turkish airlines on the same day. I requested Emirates representative to make endorsement to TK, but She replied that she couldn’t do it. I requested her make a confirmation letter about EK flight cancellation to get refund later. She replied that I could get refund where I bought tickets and there people would know everything in airline system! Finally, I myself had to purchase 02 tickets on TK on the same day to fly back home. Until now nearly 4 months over I contact Emirate many times but no refund for cancelled flight was done!","

757,"  Madrid to Male via Dubai. I have never flown Emirates until last October 27 in a holiday trip with my wife to Maldives. Madrid to Male was nothing special: economy seats have average pitch, ICE system works fine and movies selection is huge apparently. Service onboard was quite bad, food was average, flight attendants were rude, the purser spent the whole flight shouting at the crew. They never asked if we wanted more bread or more cafe etc. The flight from Dubai to Male was scheduled at 3:15 am, so we wanted nothing but sleep. Even if we put on all of our ""resting stuff"" the flight crew woke up us at 5 am for breakfast. She said that she must assure that everyone on board was offered breakfast. On our return flights we found another surprise. As the travel agency gave us the booking reference two months ago I purchased the seats, as the fare the agency took did not allow to choose seats. I paid 140€ for the seats. So far so good until we checked in at Male airport. Our seats were changed with no reason. In both flights (MLE-DXB and DXB-MAD). The handling staff could not tell me any reasonable reason, and the finished with a great ""ask Emirates staff when you arrive to Dubai"". Great answer from a professional employee. But when I tried to get an explanation at Dubai my luck did not get better: after twenty minutes trying to hold a conversation, one person who supposedly was in charge gave me a piece of paper with a web site written and told me to fill an online claim. Great airline, great staff, great service. Onboard more of the same: bad service, rude crew, poor food and added to my other trip: my entertainment system did not work. Luckily I had my ipad with lots of stuff loaded. This was my first and my last trip with Emirates.","  Madrid to Male via Dubai.

758,"  Seattle to Dubai. This was my first time with Emirates and I was expecting much more than this flight delivered. Just going down a short list: I expected better seat comfort, I hoped for more attention from the flight attendants (this was a 14 hour flight with only one visit by a flight attendant in the 14 hrs, that being after they served the meals). There were many, many children and some would not stop crying. The few bathrooms became dirty fast and stayed that way through the flight. Finally, the food was mediocre at the best. So, what I learned on my first Emirates flight is the experience of air travel with them is no better than Delta or American Airlines.","  Seattle to Dubai.

So, what I learned on my first Emirates flight is the experience of air travel with them is no better than Delta or American Airlines.","[('Seattle', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('.', None), ('first', 'a'), ('time', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('expecting', 'v'), ('much', 'r'), ('flight', 'n'), ('delivered', 'v'), ('.', None), ('going', 'v'), ('short', 'a'), ('list', 'n'), (':', None), ('expected', 'v'), ('better', 'r'), ('seat', 'n'), ('comfort', 'n'), (',', None), ('hoped', 'v'), ('attention', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('attendants', 'n'), ('(', None), ('14', None), ('hour', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('one', None), ('visit', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('attendant', 'n'), ('14', None), ('hrs', 'n'), (',', None), ('served', 'v'), ('meals', 'n'), (')', None), ('.', None), ('many', 'a'), (',', None), ('many', 'a'), ('children', 'n'), ('would', None), ('stop', 'v'), ('crying', 'n'), ('.', None), ('bathrooms', 'n'), ('became', 'v'), ('dirty', 'a'), ('fast', 'n'), ('stayed', 'v'), ('way', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Finally', 'r'), (',', None), ('food', 'n'), ('mediocre', 'v'), ('best', 'a'), ('.', None), (',', None), ('learned', 'v'), ('first', 'a'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('flight', 'n'), ('experience', 'n'), ('air', 'n'), ('travel', 'n'), ('better', 'a'), ('Delta', 'n'), ('American', 'n'), ('Airlines', 'n'), ('.', None)]","  Seattle Dubai . first time Emirates expect much flight deliver . go short list : expect well seat comfort , hop attention flight attendant ( 14 hour flight one visit flight attendant 14 hr , serve meal ) . many , many child would stop cry . bathroom become dirty fast stay way flight .

A chauffeur was booked to pick me and my daughter up and we had a hotel room booked complimentary from Emirates. When we arrived in Dubai, no one from Emirates helped me to find my chauffeur. I went to the Emirates counter and the person who was really unhelpful, cancelled my booking without asking me anything and was very rude! I had to wait for hours at the airport with my 17 months daughter. I was expecting much more from the business class from Emirates. The cabin crew during the flights was average. While my daughter was sleeping I asked one one of the crew to look after her while I was in the bathroom. She showed me that she was really annoyed to help me, she finally decided to stay as I asked her if I could get someone else to help me if she didn't want to do it. The cabin crew was eating food in front of clients and was not in a hurry to help clients. I sent a complain on the Emirates website and they answered that it will take up to 30 days before I hear from them - this unacceptable. The business class is expensive enough to deserve the treatment that goes with it. I will never book another business flight ticket with Emirates anymore.","  Sydney to Paris via Dubai.

775,"  Dubai to Johannesburg. Emirates is a joke. We were given a ""E"" and ""F"" seats at check in, on a horribly tight 3-4-3 configuration. We asked if we could be given a window or aisle seat but was refused. The check in staff then called her supervisor and said ""Hi, I am calling as two passengers would like to change their seats. I want to call because I want to let them know I have put in my effort and you can just say a no so I can please them"". This is humiliating. On the flight, the seats were the tightest I have met in economy class. The highly rated ICE system was a joke - they claimed to have over 3000 hours of inflight entertainment but in fact, most movies were the unpopular or old ones. The so called free wifi allowed you for 10 minutes of messaging only.  The food is ok, but nothing to cry for. The crews were mostly impolite, and even for the polite ones, not proactive to help on anything.

Emirates is a joke. We were given a ""E"" and ""F"" seats at check in, on a horribly tight 3-4-3 configuration. We asked if we could be given a window or aisle seat but was refused. The check in staff then called her supervisor and said ""Hi, I am calling as two passengers would like to change their seats. I want to call because I want to let them know I have put in my effort and you can just say a no so I can please them"". This is humiliating. On the flight, the seats were the tightest I have met in economy class. The highly rated ICE system was a joke - they claimed to have over 3000 hours of inflight entertainment but in fact, most movies were the unpopular or old ones. The so called free wifi allowed you for 10 minutes of messaging only.  The food is ok, but nothing to cry for.

776,"  I have flown with Emirates over several years but I won't be after my recent trip to the UK. On both legs (to Birmingham/return to Melbourne) the service left a lot to be desired after many years of excellent service. My wife who had asked for diabetic meals (in advance) had white rolls/sandwiches given to her - as was the diabetic passenger - next to her. They both explained to the staff that brown bread is what they had asked for as white bread is a no-no for those suffering with diabetes. Most of the other contents of the meals were not conducive with those with diabetes. The ""hot"" meals were late in there delivery on most occasions. There was obviously something wrong as staff members were arguing with one another saying who was at fault or wasn't. Either way, it wasn't very professional and disappointing for the customers to hear this going on - I was seating in the row in front of the cabin crew prepare the meals. I wouldn't have minded if it had only happened the once but it happened on our return flight. One has to ask why is moral so low with the Emirates air crew on Emirates these days? Why should passengers be bearing the toxic atmosphere and second rate customer service. Until there management (who the buck stops at) get there act together, I won't be rushing back to them when there are better air crews to fly with!

777,"  Sydney to Athens via Dubai. Emirates is an overpriced airline with too much marketing budget and no substance, one that I would advise others to never fly on unless they have no other options. The flight was bad, but not funny or interesting experience bad - just depressing and frustrating and not worth the money you pay for it. My food wasn't served until 6 hours into the flight (on my side of the aisle, the other side got served an hour or two earlier), attendants did not respond to the call button, and when they did serve you they did not speak, smile or even respond with a ""yes or no"" (when asked to bring water). Which was strange considering that had two shifts on board - so there was a lot of attendants wandering around, but none of them seemed to be working. The attendants ended up being more of a nuisance than service - because there were so many of them, they used the passenger's overhead bins in my area (4-5 bins, about 5 rows both sides) for their items and passengers were left with no space. In an attempt to hire as many nationalities as possible, the crew had no cohesion or chemistry - they split off into sub groups based on nationality/language and spent most of the flight gossiping and chatting with their friends. There was audible laughter when the screen popped up with a ""what did you think of this flight"", followed by several ""terrible"" from the rows in front and behind us. The in-flight entertainment system was dated and old; movies not modern and recent, and the Business Class lounge experience during the transfer in Dubai was atrocious and left a lot to be desired (again, on the service side of things). These are minor issues but the flight was so terrible that these other issues are amplified and made worse. If you're considering Emirates look at the reviews on this website, they have a 6/10 rating, which is lower than most other airlines.","  Sydney to Athens via Dubai.

778,"  Frankfurt to Cebu via Dubai. We booked through a travel agency which gave us separate bookings for every person. Online Check-in should be standard and Emirates offers it. However, the Website is hard to navigate and it takes ages to load. Then, two of us (two out of five) could not check in online. So we went to the airport and checked in the classic way. We were checking in four hours prior to departure. The first Check-in agent was really friendly, but unfortunately, she handed us over to a colleague who was rude. We tried to get seats near each other, she said no seats available.  There are hundreds of people in the queue behind us and you tell us they all have seats and you can't change it? They didn't all do the online check-in because there were seperate queues. So we don't get seats near each other, okay. We go to the gate and there is the next problem: There is a pre-boarding area. They had to get us out of there two hours before departure. It was a mess. There, they could suddenly magically change our seats. So ground service seems to be good or bad depending on your fortune. So the flight was normal. Legroom was okay but not outstanding. Recline of the seat wasn't working. The meal was great. IFE had a awesome choice, but unfortunately there was two minutes of ads before every film. When we arrived in DXB, we went to the costumer service to ask if we could get seats near each other since we were spread all over the plane. The staff was again rude and not motivated at all. She said she could not do anything for us. We got to the gate and picked up some free ice cream form Emirates (That was great, keep it up!) on the way. There was again this strange kind of first stage boarding. It was a mess. When I got my boarding pass scanned, the agent told me I've got an upgrade. Now, I don't want to complain about the upgrade, but why didn't they tell us at costumer service? They scanned our boarding passes there, and all in all three of us five go an upgrade, one of which had a gluten free meal. So they have planned the upgrade in advance. If they would have told us, we wouldn't have spent two hours on the floor.  Onboard, the Business Class was in a 2-3-2 configuration with angled flat beds. If I had paid money for this Business Class, I would have been mad at myself to not have flown any other airline. The FAs were polite, but not going out of there way to be polite. The meal was good.  No FA passed through to take care of passengers except for the meal times. This is below standard as well as the seat. In the IFE, there is the same ad as in Eco.

780,"  Toronto to Beirut via Dubai. What is the big fuss about Emirates? It was ok, nothing more than other airlines, actually the seat was not comfortable enough (business class) had part of the seat pressing against my arm left bruises that turned blue two days ago. That was because the seats are too narrow. Fly another business class and you will see the difference. Wifi was a trouble to connect to. I must say the A380 as a plane is impressive but the way it was designed inside was not the best. On my 2nd leg of the trip we flew the 777-300ER and what a terrible seating arrangement. I cant believe how they thought of putting the touch pad where you are supposed to put your hand letting you feeling you are tied during the flight. Very bothersome. Whoever is loyal to Emirates, I know they try to accumulate skyward miles, but you guys should fly other airlines business class and you should see what you are missing.

782,"  Writing review while in the aircraft to Dubai - EK 762 at 2158 Dubai time (24th September 2018) seat number 9D. Emirates business is deteriorating. 1) Check in: I had to wait at JNB because they were calling economy passengers to Business check in. 2) Lounge: Lounge at JNB quite good. The gentleman at d reception is rude and never smiled. In my over 100 lounge visits this year, never saw someone like him. He was busy on internet checking share prices. 3) Boarding: boarding was ok because boarding started before I came and mine was quick. 4) Flight: This particular business class experience is my worst to date. When I ordered a drink it took 20 mins. When I go to fetch it, the very rustic stewardess tells me she has to follow a certain order. And actually makes me wait another 10 mins before I get my drink. Food was shoddy from the first dish other than the apple tart. When I was sleeping they were celebrating with serving wine and other sweets to different couples, make them wear the funny Emirates hat and six of them including passengers were laughing away to glory while clicking pics. All this as promotion for Emirates when lights are out and people like me are trying to catch some sleep. Economy class, for third the price, offers much better experience. There is a reason why a Singapore or Qatar or Etihad get five star rating while Emirates can only make four. I am pretty convinced not to buy Emirates business class tickets for personal trips.","  Writing review while in the aircraft to Dubai - EK 762 at 2158 Dubai time (24th September 2018) seat number 9D.

To be treated like the way I was came as a complete shocker since never ever been treated like this prior to this unworthy experience. I had arrived from my flight from Taipei (Flight EK367) and was connecting Nairobi via this flight. I had 4 hours and proceeded to shop at Duty free as mentioned above has been my trend. I had checked in one luggage of 23KG in Taipei.I shopped for Chocolates. Upon heading to the boarding gate, I was stopped by an Emirates staff  who demanded I weigh my luggage before boarding. I was irritated as I noticed other passengers boarding without being stopped to and they had more luggage. I assume this must be a routine check. My boarding luggage was 4KG excess. This was understandable considering the duty free items bought. I requested the lady to consider as I had only checked in one luggage and if need be, they check in my luggage. The lady suggested I speak to the gentleman. The gentleman would not hear of it! He was rude and started telling me if I want to complain, I can do that but I have to pay the excess! My luggage cannot be checked in! Since time was running out, I proceeded to pay for the excess luggage of 4KG. Upon waiting to issue my boarding pass, two gentlemen in front of me who were boarding had more luggage and the ladies (Different completely from the one who requested to check) told the gentlemen that they would check in their luggage without even checking how many luggage they originally had checked in! How unfair! When I started to complain, I was told time is running out and should proceed for the aircraft. The whole flight was a mess and I did not enjoy due to me being stressed out and worried about the funds I had paid whilst people in the aircraft had more luggage than me.Is this really fair?  I do not mind paying for excess but a fair check has to be done across everyone boarding.","  Dubai to Nairobi.

786,  Sydney to Dubai. Emirates will make you pay for an exit row seat and refuse any sort of refund when they move you involuntarily at the last minute due to a broken seat. Unfortunately a very poor experience and I feel cheated out of the extra money i paid for exit row seats. I was told at the boarding gate as I was about to board that my 2 prepaid exit row seats ($360 paid extra on top of my normal ticket) has a broken entertainment unit. The boarding gate staff advised me that they can move me to a normal seat and refund me my $360. I was annoyed but confirmed with the staff member on the spot that he will ensure I get refunded. He assured me he will see to it and moved my allocated seats. 4 weeks has passed with no refund. I contacted Emirates via their website and explained my situation and they refuse to consider a refund - Basically I paid for a service that I did not receive on my booked flight. I will keep following up this matter with Emirates. They do not provide any contact details or means to contact them other than a very restrictive e-form on their website.

793,"  Muscat to Guangzhou via Dubai. Everything was good in the inbound flight and there was no issue. On the other hand, my outbound flight had many issues. First of all, the agents who handled the check in were not polite and knowledgeable of English so that they can understand passengers and passengers can understand them. I had an agent who told me that I have 19kg excess baggage while I was sure that I have checked the baggage three times in my hotel and they were with in the limit. I asked the agent to double check and put them on the scale again individually since he was putting them all together and hand calculating the total weight. The agent refused to do so and refused to ask for his supervisor to come and kept saying ""It is Dubai, Check with Dubai"" He was about to return all the bags to me until I make the payment, I told him Ok check the bags and finish the check in so that my family and I will go and do the payment. He said ""first make payment and then will check the bags""! He kept my family standing there with my children and I went to do the payment. When I asked the other agent also to go and check or ask that guy in the counter to check she refused and said the same ""check with Dubai"". I paid the $570 for 19kg which I really think it is ridiculously insane charge for 19kg. In front of the gate, several agents were collecting the carry on bags to check them in for free and they did check all my carry on bags that weighs more than 20kg. Then they asked to take my cabin friendly baby stroller to check in because they where not aware of this type of strollers, although I informed them about it and showed them how it folds but they did not listen and they were unaware of this type of stroller. I purchased this type so that baggage handling dont break my stroller. They lost one of my baggage and I could not get it before the Eid.

799, Two more great flights with Emirates from London to Melbourne via Dubai. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 3 was quick and efficient and the lounge was marvellous especially for a plane spotter like myself. Boarding was smooth and a glass of nice Champagne offered before take-off. Staff were efficient and friendly and the food and wine offered were superb. Landed in Dubai and headed to lounge as the next flight to Melbourne departed at 2.20 am. Again a smooth boarding and even at that hour of the day a glass of bubbly was on offer and also the staff handed out hot towels and the mattress for the bed. Breakfast was promptly served and after a movie I slept for about 7 hours and then enjoyed a delicious lunch even though it was closer to dinner time at our destination. The multi national crew were fantastic. I usually ask where they come from and its almost like a mobile United Nations conference. Overall an outstanding pair of flights yet again and I really enjoy flying long haul with Emirates., Two more great flights with Emirates from London to Melbourne via Dubai.

800,"  Kuwait to Lyon return via Dubai. I usually fly with Qatar Airways in Business class but they don't offer this route yet. I was terribly unsatisfied with Emirates product on these flights. First, the 2-3-2 configuration on their B777-300 is outdated and lacks comfort and privacy. The seats are old and screens often don't work properly. On my flight from Dubai to Kuwait, on the A380, my seat was not even clean and i found toothbrush protection on the cocktail table. Second, on my 4 flights during my trip, only 1 crew was attentive and nice to me. The others were not caring about passengers and were snobby and arrogant. Dinner is served on a tray and food not nicely presented (i'd call it economy in business). As for beverages (I usually drink wine during dinner), you can't expect it to be served after you finished your dinner. The crew were disorganized. Last, the internet on board was not working on any of the segments. I am totally disappointed in this airline which markets itself as one of the best. I'll definitely be flying other airline next time and be treated as a business class passenger.","  Kuwait to Lyon return via Dubai.

801," Flown a total of 4 legs (Hamburg to Beijing via Dubai) with 36 persons together booked individually. Check In process was rather complicated because of pre-assigned seats but managed to pack the group together. Luggage drop off in Hamburg was very unfriendly and machine like by AHS staff with shouting throughout the terminal. But Emirates representative was very friendly and helpful with checking in 36 baggage pieces. Flight experience was superb. Several services were offered on all flights and asking for beverages in the galley was possible at all times. Paper menus were offered. Friendly and multi lingual cabin crew on all legs. Very caring for 5 ill kids throughout leg PEK-DXB. Greetings and good bye with not only professional smile. We were afraid of B777 10 abreast configuration - a bit tight but not cramped at all with 6'1"" height. Living space in A380 was superb. Partly bad reviews could not be verified using Emirates on those 4 legs.

806,"  Amsterdam to Male via Dubai. Disappointed. Somehow there is a myth that this is a great airline. Legroom is great as is the entertainment system. But with that all is said on the greatness. Flight delays are badly communicated (both to and from Dubai) and service is really poor. 2-2,5 hrs after take off you get served while having waited at the gate for 2 hrs (1,5 hrs delay) Cart is sitting in the aisle for 1,5 hrs before they start using it. No glass of water offered and on a six hour night flight you don’t wait for over two hours to serve drinks or meals. Crew not unfriendly but for far friendly. If I can avoid I won’t fly again.

811,  Melbourne to London via Dubai. Early start with EK 409 departing Melbourne at 5.00 am so arrived at airport at 2.30 am to check in. Ground staff were great but warned me that immigration and security would not open until 3.00 am! As you can imagine with a full flight there were hundreds of passengers lined up to go through this process. Was given a priority lane pass which made the progress much easier. Boarding was prompt but could have stayed in the lounge as it had an excellent breakfast menu and great seating. On board was offered a glass of French which at 4.30 am is the only way to start the day. Seat was more than comfortable and the staff were first rate. Breakfast offering after take-off included a healthy option or the more traditional fare of bacon and eggs etc. The crew now use an electronic form on smart devices to take your order. Lunch was served 2 hours from landing and again an excellent choice. Landed on time and after 90 minutes it was off to London on EK 003. Again the crew were welcoming and drinks offered before take off and orders promptly taken when airborne. More food served before landing at London Heathrow and landing was right on time. On each flight passengers are offered a mattress to put on the seat and in some cases an extra pillow. ICE system is brilliant and a great selection to choose from and the cameras on the aircraft are a must watch for landing and take-off. Overall a fantastic long haul experience with friendly crew and great service. Could not recommend more highly.,  Melbourne to London via Dubai.

819,"  London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion. I have flown with Emirates since the late 90's and had not used them recently. I decided to use them this year. What a shock! This was not the Emirates that I used to know and liked immensely. Their aircraft are dirty and their staff, both on the ground and in the air, are inept and downright rude. In my particular case, i originally booked flights from Gatwick to Manila, via a two hour stopover in Dubai. After paying for the flights, Emirates emailed me to say that the schedules had changed and I was now on a flight from Heathrow with a one hour stopover in Dubai. To be honest, i was somewhat wary of such a tight connection time but I (in hindsight) stupidly trusted Emirates to get me to my destination on time. Well, the inevitable happened. The flight from Heathrow was delayed, thus causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila. Incidentally, having checked this particular flight (EK004), it appears that it has been late departing from Heathrow virtually every evening. I would love to know how many other Manila bound passengers have missed their connection in this way over the last three months. The Emirates ground crew at Dubai were next to useless, accommodating us in a shabby hotel in Dubai for a few hours and then sticking us on a Hong Kong bound flight that evening, to connect with a Philippine Airlines flight the following morning. In short, a planned 17 hour, 1 stop journey became a 30 hour, 2 stop journey. I contacted Emirates and asked why we had not been placed on the direct flight from Dubai to Manila that evening. We would have still been late, but at least we would not have had to connect in Hong Kong. As yet, no answer. In fact, the response from Emirates has been condescending and wholly unsatisfactory. The Dubai ground crew and the Emirates customer service office give the impression that they are doing the delayed passengers a huge favour by shipping them out on a little bus to a Dubai hotel for a few hours and then placing them on later, non-direct flights. The customer services rep in his email to me even had the brass neck to point out how expensive it is for Emirates to re-book us on to another airline at Hong Kong.  Here's an idea Emirates, stop re-scheduling passengers on to flights with almost impossible connection times and get your passengers to their destinations as advertised. In conclusion, we missed a late evening meet up with friends in Manila and I had to fork out £160 for new internal flights to our final destination, as we had missed our original flights in Manila. Any potential Emirates passengers out there, read these reviews and take heed. Avoid the headaches and book with an airline who actually know what they are doing. I certainly shall in future.","  London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion.

820,"  We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai. Due to bad weather in Europe our plane was late departing and we spent over two hours on the runway. Consequently we missed our connecting flight in Dubai. When we finally reached Dubai there was complete chaos. There were 200+ other people who also missed connections and it was not clear where to go. We followed the crowd to the desk area for help there were only 4 Emirates staff helping over 200 people get to their final destinations. We were trying to get to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania to meet a further connecting flight to start a 5 night safari. After after about a 45 minute wait we eventually got to speak to someone who said we could get an 8 hour flight to Johannesburg then a further flight to back to Dar Es Salaam. This would mean we would have got to Dar Es Salaam too late to catch our final connection and would have missed two days of our safari. Out of a 5 night safari this is a significant portion. When I complained I was told to stop wasting his time. Other people were also being badly treated. One other passenger found a replacement flight online and asked to be transferred but was told you've got your ticket don't speak to me anymore. Bearing in mind Emirates knew early on that the plane would be delayed they had over 8 hours to sort this out what they came up with was completely inadequate. It seemed everyone was being sent to Johannesburg. As the flight to Johannesburg was 4am the next morning we were sent to a hotel to wait. When we got to the hotel there were hundreds of other people waiting to check in as well. We queued in reception for over 3 hours to get our room but I'm not sure why we bothered as we had no luggage as this was still at the airport. Thankfully our tour operator Audley Travel managed to book us onto a flight to Zanzibar and then onto Dar Es Salaam in time to meet our final connection and only miss 1 day of our holiday and not 2. The flight to Zanzibar was with FlyDubai which is owned by the same people as Emirates. Why couldn't we have been offered this option by Emirates? You would hope this was the end of our bad experience with Emirates but no. When we went to come home we turned up at the airport in Dar Es Salaam over 3 hours before our flight was due to leave but were told by the check in staff that they could not print our boarding passes. The reason for this is because our tickets were out of sequence. It seems you have have to go wherever Emirates wish to send you in this case Johannesburg regardless of wether you wish to go there or not. We spent a further three hours at the airport in Dar Es Salaam not knowing if we would be able to go home. They said it was a security issue but they could clearly see our passports, they could see when we arrived in Tanzania as our visa was stamped with the date of arrival and they would have known our luggage had been transferred to a different flight. Only thanks to the persistence of the check in manager at Dar Es Salaam who spent over 2 hours on the phone and the immigration officials who sped us through security did we make the flight back home with only 2 minutes to spare. All in all I would definitely not recommend Emirates as an airline. It seems they can only run an airline if things run smoothly but are completely out of there depth if they hit a problem. The mark if a good company is how they deal with things when problems arise and in my view they completely failed","  We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai.

821,"  Durban to Athens via Dubai. Emirates standards have dropped considerably. They don’t even have the food which they are offering on the menu, the menu offers a choice but when you choose the fish they say they don’t have. On this particular flight they even admitted they had hardly any of the fish option. On the next flight my wife was lucky enough to score the last chicken meal and I was forced to accept the beef. Also, the food was generally bland and I would hazard a guess they have changed caterers. They have also cut a few corners in the meal, for example the little chocolate has disappeared. They also didn’t offer the usual overnight packs (tooth brush, eye thingy etc)...when I enquired about this I was told they only offer these on flights exceeding 9 hours and the first leg of our flight was about 8 hours. This must be a new policy, as we have always received these packs. I have for many years regarded Emirates as the worlds best airline, but after experiencing these cost cutting measures, I will gladly forfeit my skywards miles and go back to Qatar or Etihad.","  Durban to Athens via Dubai.

This is what we were served on a 16 hour flight - they served soft drinks/juice and wine and alcohol 45 minutes after the first meal was served. Alcohol/wine is generally served 30 minutes prior to food service. The Dubai terminal was resembling a fish market. There were approx 120 seats near the gate. They are using A380-800 which is 475 to 500 passengers on a flight. The number of seats were totally inadequate. The staff serves food and drinks - but when you ask for something they dont have like Diet Coke/Diet Pepsi they say 'sir I have apple juice/orange juice' - They want passenger to believe they do not have Diet coke/diet pepsi. They are not willing to walk a bit and get the diet coke from the pantry for the passenger. Movies/TV shows were in large quantity but lacked quality. The staff do not clean the toilets on a 16 hour flight. This is not a premium airline - this resembles a budget airline.,  Los Angeles to Mumbai via Dubai.

826,"  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. At the recommendation of the cruise company we booked with, who said they receive a very good deal with Emirates we had them book our flights. Prior to leaving we phoned Emirates to arrange seat allocations, after this was done we were informed that we were to be charged an extra $200AUD for this booking. After complaining to the cruise company they did pay this cost. This is the first time we have ever had to pay for booking seat allocations on any airline we have travelled on overseas. As my wife has a medical condition that prevents her from eating anything spicy we checked out the food options with Emirates and their representative was very understanding and recommended that the best option was a Western Vegan Meal, this was confirmed in a email from them. On the flight to Dubai/ Rome WHAT happens, my wife's meal arrives and if not the sauces then whether the fish,chicken,beef or pork all come out with curry in it. Regardless of complaints no other option available, no spare standard meal either. However, on the Dubai to Rome section when the same meal problem arose the cabin crew supervisor asked us for our flight details and said she would arrange to cancel this ""vegan"" meal option and it would mean my wife would have the choice of the regular meals on our return flights home from Barcelona. Somewhere in cyberspace this arrangement still lingers, for on our flight from Barcelona history repeated itself. Once again, No spare meals available so as before my wife had a whatever I could give her off mine, likewise the same issue came up on the flight from Dubai to Melbourne. Just to add insult to injury, as we were seated near the galley we saw meal trays dropped on the floor and the noise coming from there was loud to say the least, also we feel the toilets could have been more regularly checked as the basins needed cleaning and toilet rolls replaced as well as refuse bins emptied. Seated next to me was a young man with a liking for gin and tonics, He was seen ordering ""doubles "" e.g. two bottles at a time and also helping himself to the bar which was parked behind our seats. Added to this he decided it was more comfortable to squat on the seat with his posterior almost on the headrest of the seat. Of course what happened next was predictable, a full drink spilled all over me, so with using our blankets to clean up this mess and dry me off we needed two clean blankets. Request for same met with the reply that no spare blankets available, which meant we spent the rest of the flight cold no thanks to the air-con. However, just before arrival a flight attendant was seen collecting unused blankets and passed us with a large bag three quarters full of unused blankets, two of which I am sure could have been found with a little effort so we didn't go cold.

833,"  I had a bad experience with Emirates customer service before in the past and it didn't change. I thought this was a good airline and happily purchased an unaccompanied minor ticket for my son which was expensive already at over 1700$. I gave all required information for pick up etc. to the airline and they assured me that they have all info. Unfortunately, on my sons flying date they needed more info (which they never informed me about) and tried to call me but never reached me and just didn't board my son. The next day I complained about this treatment and was forced to pay another 500$ to no fault of mine. They said I could get the money back through customer service. I did complain and stated my case but I only received an unfriendly rejection. Therefore this ticket cost me 2300$ which is higher than any other airline. In addition, my sons next day flight got delayed so that he missed the connection in Dubai due to Emirates fault. He had to spend the night at the airport to finally arrive another day later! This unprofessional treatment with poor customer service and delays is unacceptable. Last year I used Lufthansa with my son and no surprises/ unfair increase of rates/ no delays/ no problems- What a difference!

838,"  I can’t describe how upset I am by being stuck on Fl Dubai plane for 5 hours with no food, drink, in-flight entertainment or internet. I did book Moscow to Hanoi via Dubai  specifically to fly with Emirates, that cost me 650USD one way, compared to Aeroflot 650USD/round trip which is direct, modern and safe anyway. I paid twice as much just to have an experience with Emirates. Instead of Emirates plane I found myself in an outdated shabby unsafe little aircraft. I never been send to a low-cost instead of a full service. How is that even possible a company like Emirates co-shares with a lower cost. By co-sharing I mean they stuck me on a lower cost, send one meal, 1 cup of free water and let me carry 30kg of luggage. There was no choice of food and the suggested free dinner, only one option, was not suitable for me, no free snacks available no nothing. I had to buy water and peanuts. I booked a ticket with Emirates for my husband London-Dubai-Hanoi round trip and he had an amazing flight despite his flight was longer and the price was cheaper. I don’t book planes which sell water and sandwiches and I would never in a conscious mind choose Fly Dubai for a 5 hours flight, seats were uncomfortable even for my 5 feet. It was freezing cold the entire time and no blankets available, I couldn’t even hear the announcement it was just cracking noise. The whole experience felt like a charter flight in 90s, I never saw flight attendants just sleeping on the back row on a 5 hours flight before, our departure was also delayed because of late arrival. I couldn’t even charge my phone up to 60% in 5 hours, the equipment was that old!

839,  Auckland to Birmingham via Brisbane / Dubai. The B777 on the Brisbane to Dubai leg was cramped and dirty. The A380 on the Dubai-Birmingham leg had more leg room. It was A380s on the return journey to Melbourne. Having heard people rate Emirates I was so disappointed. Each flight was late (by about an hour each time) departing. The cabin service was poor. We were offered one alcoholic drink for the whole of a 14 hour flight. The food was so salty as to be inedible and being on a special diet for medical reasons I couldn't eat anything that the airports offered. If the baggage locker over your seat row was full you had to find space somewhere else which could be several rows back. The cabin crew refused to help. So no I never want to use this airline again.

We were offered one alcoholic drink for the whole of a 14 hour flight. The food was so salty as to be inedible and being on a special diet for medical reasons I couldn't eat anything that the airports offered. If the baggage locker over your seat row was full you had to find space somewhere else which could be several rows back. The cabin crew refused to help. So no I never want to use this airline again.

When arriving at my gate and waiting for my flight, my flight information was not up on the screen when it was supposed to be boarding.

847,"  Rome to Dubai. An excellent flight on Emirates. Boarding at FCO on the A380 now faster, smoother thanks to the new departure gate at FCO with dual level air stairs. Nice welcome on board by smiling, professional crew. Took off 30 mins late due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft (due, no doubt, to delays at DXB during the morning departure rush between 07.30 - 10.00) but time was made up and we later landed on schedule. Someone says on earlier report that EK doesn't ask for feedback? There's a digital survey card contained within ICE or you can report your comments to one of the cabin supervisors. I did this as I wanted to comment on the fact that EK no longer offers a pre-lunch drinks service on this route instead combining the meal and cocktail service together. I understand why this is - some people want to eat as soon as they sit down - but it does make the initial part of the cabin service rather rushed, which is unnecessary on a 5.5 hour flight. In the past on this route ice cream was served about 4 hours into the flight but this has now been replaced with a sandwich and tea / coffee. Lunch, incidentally, was excellent (braised beef, gratin potatoes and the most delicious crumble for dessert), and I write that as someone who doesn't usually take the meal on this sector. Being extra picky here but it's a shame Campari is no longer offered as a cocktail in economy but good to note there was a selection of three different types of red wine. Everyone knows the ICE entertainment system is absolutely superb and caters for all nationalities / languages, I often watch Italian or French movies. This time, it even included live World Cup football. And the economy seats on EK's A380s are so comfortable and spacious.

In the past on this route ice cream was served about 4 hours into the flight but this has now been replaced with a sandwich and tea / coffee. Lunch, incidentally, was excellent (braised beef, gratin potatoes and the most delicious crumble for dessert), and I write that as someone who doesn't usually take the meal on this sector. Being extra picky here but it's a shame Campari is no longer offered as a cocktail in economy but good to note there was a selection of three different types of red wine. Everyone knows the ICE entertainment system is absolutely superb and caters for all nationalities / languages, I often watch Italian or French movies. This time, it even included live World Cup football. And the economy seats on EK's A380s are so comfortable and spacious.

850,"  London to Adelaide via Dubai / Brisbane. I am very surprised that huge airlines like Emirates do not ask you to review them after your flight. Do they not want to know about problems or have feedback? Obviously not. I heard it was rated best airline but by whom? I have travelled with them and other large airlines but not been asked to vote for them good or bad. Well I review them as bad. It is not made clear during booking how much seat allocation is going to cost you until after you have paid for your flight (apparently hidden somewhere in the smallprint) You should have the opportunity DURING the booking process to add your chosen seats then you would not have to add them on extra later. I paid £180 for return flight for me and my child to sit together. That was just allocating the two cheapest seats together. The flights were £1500+. They told me I could book 2 seats together within 48 hours of flying for free if there were any left - thats if. The airport terminal in Dubai is enormous and we only just made it to the gate for the next leg on time. They need longer on the ground before next flight. Myself and my son, the people to my side that I could see clearly did not eat the food apart from scones. The green sausages looked like plasticine. The white sausages again looked and tasted of plasticine. It states clearly on the website all children travelling will be allocated child meals automatically 24 hours before travel. They do not. If I wanted my child to have child meals I had to personally phone on all 4 legs of the journey to book each one. It is not available to do this online, but meals like kosher and vegetarian are! Ridiculous. And when we boarded, after an hour of take off my son was really thirsty so pressed the bell for water - it took over 40 minutes for him to be attended and the people behind me kept pressing too but nobody came to them either. I will not choose to fly Emirates again, over priced and over rated. I've been with Malaysian Airlines and Qantas before and will go back to them next time as I never encountered one problem with either airline.","  London to Adelaide via Dubai / Brisbane.

855,"  Larnaca to Singapore via Dubai. Our flight from Cyprus got delayed more than an hour so we missed our connecting flight from Dubai to Singapore. As all other airlines do we thought that a group of flight attendants wold escort us to the new gate to catch the next flight, we also informed the flight attendants in our flight from Cyprus to Dubai to do so and they ensured us that this was going to be done and nothing to worry about. We needed to reach Singapore the following morning as we had a very important meeting arranged at the airport. However coming out the aisle none called our names and none would answer our questions on how to reach the next gate. They would only tell us that we missed the next flight as well and that there is no chance of us arriving on time to the gate to get the next one. After a lot of drama with the useless connection manager we lost a lot of valuable time with result of missing the next flight as well. It was simply horrible. Never experienced worse service in my life, not even with a budget airline. After arranging to stay in Dubai in order to have our meeting online we realized that we got an email from the airline that they rescheduled our seats for the following flight, and we could have made it on time if we saw the email earlier and not listed to the negative outcome from the unhelpful ''manager''. This is the second time this happened to my husband with this airline and we want to tell the travelers out there not to waste their valuable time and money well earned to throw it to them.

858,"  Dubai to Boston. Very disappointed. Seat narrow, doesn't like flat, not very comfortable, although supplied mattress helps a lot. Inflight entertainment system was unreliable and difficult to operate, despite multiple screens. Food was terrible and surprisingly scarce. Was hungry getting off a 12 hour flight, which is a rare experience in business on most airlines. Cabin service was lackluster at best - this was the biggest surprise. I had a hard time getting a drink then was offered bourbon when I had ordered scotch. I didn't drink it and after many hours they took it away. Much later in flight, male flight attendant argued with me that the drink had been scotch not bourbon. (I'm pretty positive I can tell the difference) If there was a 'snack' offered late in the flight (that was on the menu) I did not see or hear about it. Overall I will not choose Emirates again unless there are compelling circumstances.","  Dubai to Boston. Very disappointed.

She tried to make a sort of a stool with a bag to make me stretch my leg. When arrived in Dubai they told me I had to go to the service desk and tell them what happened. The guy in Dubai who took me on my wheelchair, instead, left me for a while “parked” while he was happily chatting with other friends until I waved to get his attention and asked again to be taken to the service desk. Finally at service desk I explained the situation and what I had endured in Melbourne. They said they would take me to the lounge to wait.

860,"  Venice to Melbourne via Dubai. I am now on my way back to Australia and yet again experiencing the worst customer service ever from Emirates. Just before my departure I had received an offer to upgrade from economy to business for part of my return trip from Dubai to Melbourne for AU$ 1157 . As my leg had not yet healed ( did my way into Europe on a wheelchair) and although feeling much better, I thought I could do this effort and upgrade so that I could be more comfortable. Before my departure I tried several times to do the online upgrade but unsuccessfully, as every time i filled everything and clicked “upgrade” a message came out that “the system was down”! (Note that my card was more than capable of covering the cost hence it was not a payment issue ) Tried again before I had to catch my first flight but then I had to board and had to let go. Arrived in Dubai I went to the service desk where there was only single person available to do the ticketing service and was stuck serving a person for over 20 minutes! I had another person before me and I knew I would never had time to wait so I went to another side of the service desk to ask for assistance. The lady said no one else could assist and also that she knew for sure I could not upgrade with that offer anymore as I had already started the first leg. When I explained that I did try many times to do the upgrade online before my flight but the Emirates website did not work and a message came out that the system was down (so it was not my fault) they just said they could not do anything and if I wanted to upgrade the price would not have been the same! On the plane I asked again. They had quite a few empty seats in business but they asked almost 4 times as much as the offer I had in my email (asked around 3.500 US dollars for one leg upgrade on the plane! While my offer was 1157 Australian dollars for the same which equals to us$ 864) I am so angry and disappointed but, if you want to see this from a marketing point of view Emirates has lost both in image and in money. In fact those seats have remained empty and Emirates has now another very upset and angry customer who has been loyal for years.

862,"  Brussels to Tokyo via Dubai. Plenty of flights with Emirates the last few weeks with several round trips to Sydney, Brisbane and Tokyo. Being a Platinum member, Emirates upgrade me from Business to First every 4-5 flights. I rate Business class on the A380 above Business on the 77W, but also better than First. The seat in First remains awkward. To me, Emirates are outstanding for route network, lounges services and catering, website booking/managing, chauffeur pickup, seat comfort, onboard wifi, crews, and of course their unique ICE inflight entertainment. Where Emirates do not get their act together however, is for inflight catering, which remains surprisingly awful also in First. I always eat at the airport before my flight.

869,"  Amsterdam to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates in May 2018. It was genuinely a disappointing trip and  confirmed just how overrated Emirates is. On the AMS-DXB sector, every Cabin Crew member genuinely looked like they did not want to be there. People would move out of their way in the aisle to make way for the crew and were never given a single smile or ""thank you"" of acknowledgement. They were far from friendly, could not crack a smile, and appeared like emotionless robots. The seats were so uncomfortable and you could feel the framework of them beneath your behind because the seats had been sat in so many thousands of times without re-upholstering. That's not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was a joke. Please don't get me started on it. On not one, but both sectors, there was no recognition in their system that I had requested a vegetarian meal, so I was lucky to be graced with ""untouched leftover"" vegetarian meals on both sectors, but only for one meal on each flight. The Cabin Crew on the first flight couldn't stop reminding me how lucky I was and that it was my fault and patronised me, repeatedly saying ""mmm yes, just next time you must request your meal beforehand."" They seemed to have not listened to a word I said. Regardless, there was not even a vegetarian option on the actual menu. ","  Amsterdam to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates in May 2018.

870," This was my first experience with Emirates, and I was surprised how average it was. Maybe expectations were too high, but this experience was just not as good as Emirates promotes itself (best airline? Really?) The aircraft was not new and a few seats were damaged. The cabin was not clean. The staff were not friendly, and once they totally ignored my request for assistance. Entertainment system was not very handy: the touchscreen was not working properly on both flights, so I had to use an old and an uncomfortable joystick. I didn't like the selection of movies, either - there were many movies in the database (including Asian, Bollywood etc) but all of the Western movies were more or less of the same genre. Same with TV shows. The dinner was very good, however, only one real meal on a long haul flight was not sufficient (only an old sandwich was given before landing). There were no snacks or beverages in between. No amenity kits provided. There was wifi onboard; 2 hours free. On a positive note, you can check-in 2 bags, 32 kg each. Overall, it was all okay because Emirates flight was the cheapest one among all flights available for this route and date. I would be very disapointed otherwise, though."," This was my first experience with Emirates, and I was surprised how average it was.

871,"  Bangkok to Hong Kong. This was truly a flight to remember. The seat went beyond comfortable; it was luxurious. This was a short flight, so my interest in the IFE was limited to the flight map and the external cameras - what a treat! There were so many flight attendants assigned to the business cabin that the service was personalized and super attentive. Once again, I enjoyed the lounge food so much that I had little appetite left for the elaborate onboard meal. I ordered the ""mild"" chicken curry. I should known that my interpretation of mild and that of the Thai catering service might vary considerably. I had contacted Emirates customer service ahead of the flight with a special request. Their communication was exemplary, and they accommodated me beyond what I Had hoped for. The only drawback to this flight that I can comment upon is that it has spoiled me for flying with anyone else. I will have to adjust my expectations.","  Bangkok to Hong Kong.

874," Hong Kong to Bangkok. Departure delayed by an hour due to a technical fault which could not be fixed with another Emirates A380 due to fly HKG non-stop to DXB three hours 25 minutes earlier. Some passengers from that flight were transferred to ours. But why that should have resulted in a lengthy delay to our flight beats me and was never explained. As a result we had to sit on board for over an hour before push-back. Once again I found the revised upper deck layout with 100 or so Y passengers in front of business class especially annoying, this time with what seemed like a major raucous party taking place just a few rows in front of my seat. Having travelled for much of the day and connected in HKG, I found it impossible to relax, the more so as the plane was being refuelled and the lighting full on. How come refuelling took place after the scheduled departure time given that our aircraft had arrived in HKG several hours earlier? Although hungry, I skipped dinner as midnight was just too late for me. All I wanted was try and sleep but even that was difficult with the short flight time. I appreciate that technical issues do occur and I felt sorry for those who had to be involuntarily rerouted via BKK and would as a result arrive late in DXB by six hours or more. For those of us who had elected to take the Bangkok flight, though, this was maddening! The lack of detailed explanations was even more so."," Hong Kong to Bangkok.

875,"  Munich to Jakarta via Dubai. The quality and service with Emirates has gone downhill within years. Upon arrival in Munich, I am informed that one of the seats in the A380 is damaged and been told to change the seat. In addition to that, customer ignored the seating requested. The seat is damaged was located in the window seat and only middle seat available, because it is a full flight. Never experience like this before on other airline. The first food was edible and the second one (before landing) was awful. The entertainment on my seat was broken, asking staff for help but ignored this helped. The WI-FI is free for several minutes but you must pay again after that. Last leg on DXB-CGK this is at least better than the MUC-DXB route which everything works fine. The service on the A380 was unacceptable with lack of customer support who decides on changing seat for the customers that flies the A380. In the future, I will avoid their A380 because of this issues with IFE etc. I have sent complaint to the airline which I’m still waiting for any replies about this experience.","  Munich to Jakarta via Dubai.

877," Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai. First flight, on time boarding done very efficiently due to empty flight. Crew were very nice telling passengers sat in full rows that there were free rows scattered around the plane that they could move to. Plane was brand new, great seats, great entertainment system. Food was 50/50. On time arrival into Dubai but delayed due to having to go to a remote stand and taking a bus that took 40 minutes! to get to the terminal. Got to the terminal and realised I left my onwards boarding pass on the plane but the staff issued me a new one very quickly. Second flight boarded on time as well however, we were an hour late taking off due to the weather but the crew made up for it. Like the first flight, crew were excellent and the food was a lot better on the 2nd leg. Sat on the upper deck, definitely recommend it as the more private cabin and the side compartments are really good. Overall, great experience with Emirates."," Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai.

878,"  I had prepurchased a seat for extra legroom, but the layout didnt state that the seat is next to the staff kitchen/pantry. And because of this, I receive constant noises and laughter from the staff, even when the public lights are off, waking me up at several times. That's not all, I had paid for extra legroom, but people are constantly knocking my long stretch legs over, causing me to retract my legs all the time. Hence, the irony of purchasing an extra legroom when in fact, I don't get any throughout the flight. To make things worst, there are 2 staff seats opposite our seats, so during landing and take off, 2 staff will be sitting there. And because they are sitting there, I have to retract my  legs again. I'd paid for extra legroom, but in the end, it was a terrible experience. Never again am I going to prepurchase a legroom at the sides of the plane, especially from Emirates. Terrible experience. As for the other experiences, most of the crew were ok, they will serve and do their job, but lack the smile on their face. Not that they look rude or unhappy, it's just not the expression you will receive in flights like Singapore Air. Inflight entertainment was good, great contents, but the touchscreen was terrible. Touchscreen is based on a mouse cursor on screen. If you touch a particular button, you need to do it a few times so that the cursor will understand that it should be at your thumb. Hence, a difficult screen to control.","  I had prepurchased a seat for extra legroom, but the layout didnt state that the seat is next to the staff kitchen/pantry.

880,"  We flew from London to Manila via Dubai and back. Boarding wasn't stressful. Legroom was good and the seats had a good recline. It was enough for me to sleep when I needed to. However, I did get very numb towards the end of the flights. At 8-9 hours per leg, this wasn't unexpected. The quality of the food was good. I had the gluten free meal and my partner the normal. Both flavour, variety and good portion sizes. I didn't feel like the gluten free option meant I had substandard food, so I would take this into account if you have any intolerances. The entertainment was very good. We were spoilt for choice for films and TV shows, and the inflight status was a nice extra. The larger screens were on two of our flights, and were much more responsive than the smaller, older versions on our other two flights. For the smaller screens, we just used the physical controllers, but these were easy enough to use too. All of the staff were highly professional, prompt and courteous. We had a few smiles as well.  All in all I'm very happy with my experience from Emirates. The flight weren't cheap at £580 return, but there were many cheaper options available. I'm glad we chose to pay the extra £100 for Emirates as the extra comfort went a long way for such a big journey.","  We flew from London to Manila via Dubai and back. Boarding wasn't stressful.

885," Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai. I’ve used Emirates for connecting flights several times and decided never to use it again. I recommend everyone to avoid a connecting flight in Dubai with Emirates. The airport is huge and making a transfer in the airport requires a lot of time and patience. It is always very crowded and even finding somewhere to sit except restaurants or cafes sometimes impossible. There are always long queues for security checks. The terrible flight experience in my recent flight proved it: Emirates recommends to spare at least 1 hour for making transfer in Dubai. In my latest flight from Bangkok to Istanbul, the connection time was 1hour 15 minutes. The flight from Bangkok to Dubai delayed 45 minutes, which means that I will definitely miss my flight in Dubai to Istanbul. Despite this fact, ground staff in Bangkok reassured me that I would make the connection and there would be a ground staff at Dubai airport waiting to assist for the connection flight to Istanbul. When I arrived at Dubai airport 45 minutes delayed, the ground personal informed me that my seat to Istanbul was cancelled and handed me the voucher for a hotel and food. She told me that my flight would be tomorrow at 2.30 pm UAE time. With no further assistance she left. I had many more troubles in the latter times of my journey. The response I received from the customer service regarding my complaints were not satisfactory and disrespectful. My latter complaints were totally ignored. Other issues with this airline: Their seat layout 3-4-3 seat, which means the corridors are thin and the cabin is filled more passengers. It makes you feel claustrophobic. One annoying thing about their entertainment system is that you have to watch several commercials before the movies or any other videos. Yes it is cheaper compared to other airlines and maybe should be listed in budget airline category."," Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai.

888,"  Dubai to Bangkok. Emirates have an economy class seats on the upper deck of their A380. I got the chance to reserve the seat in advance. The upper cabin is spacious than the lower cabin with 2-4-2 layout. Add to that the side storage bins for those seating in the window seat. The flight was full because of the Songkran Festival in Thailand. Drinks and a small pack of biscuit was given right after take off. Lunch was serve almost two hours into the flight which i guess is a bit early for a 6 hour flight. Drinks and wet towel were provided before we land. The front lavatory on the upper deck are spacious. Unfortunately, those seating on the upper deck cannot go down the lower deck to roam and stretch their legs. Emirates' ICE is was superb.

889,  Hyderabad to New York via Dubai. Emirates standards have really dropped. Cons: Emirates b class lounge in terminal b in morning time is a joke. Food is consistently bad in these lounges and there is no a la carte. There is not a single chair to sit on. Horrible experience. Very noisy with spoons and plates clattering all the time. There are a ton of food options but all of them mass produced and on a hot dish. In flight experience also Emirates has no a la carte concept. Either you chose from that menu in those 3 hours or forget about it. No good soups or mild flavours they again gs for quantity over quality. During the entire time of 15 hours cabin crew is going by back and forth making sleep difficult. TheWorst part however is the fact that there is lounge in JFK. This is simple not acceptable. They give a 40 usd voucher which you can Use in any restaurant but almost all restaurants were closing. So I had a glass of wine and fries in McDonald’s. This is unacceptable. Pros: flight attendants on all sectors were very nice and tried to make up for an old and tired airline.

892,"  Sydney to Christchurch. Incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel that may cost me over $400 On April 8, 2018, my wife and I were travelling on EK412 from Sydney to Christchurch. We were carrying an expensive PC as a gift to our daughter for her graduation from the university that we purchased in Australia and we planned to claim tax refund. It’s a common knowledge (and a common sense, too) that goods need to be produced to a tax refund officer to obtain tax refund. To our knowledge, at Sydney Airport tax refund office is located beyond check-in, immigration and security and I intended to bring the PC there. The box was pretty bulky, and I was told that I had to check it in. It was a natural question that I asked the check-in assistant – how was I supposed to produce it to a tax refund officer if I do that. The junior assistant who was checking us in didn’t know the answer and asked her supervisor by name David. David assured us that producing receipt to a tax refund officer was sufficient to claim tax and that goods don’t need to be necessarily produced if they’re checked in, so we checked the box in along with our luggage. At the tax refund office, the officer requested me to produce the goods besides the receipt, which I was unable to do. The officer then said that I had to produce it to a tax refund officer located before check-in point, of which the airline should have informed me. When I replied that the airline advised me that the good don’t need to be produced to a tax refund officer and producing receipt alone is sufficient to claim tax refund, the officer still accepted my claim but it’s now up to decision of the main office in Canberra, whether I will receive tax refund after not being able to produce the goods. Thus, the incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel in matters of tax refund may cost me over $400 if my claim is ultimately not entertained. What are you going to do about this, Emirates?","  Sydney to Christchurch.

894," Aircraft interior space including food and beverages were more than average. But the service by the ground and cabin crew were terrible and not acceptable. Unbelievably, they do not respond to the guests. They do not say a word other than ""commands"" to guests. They talk only when they have to instruct guests.

896," This was an absolutely fantastic experience on Emirates first class from Dubai to Manchester on EK17 on April 8th. Its been a while since I last flew with Emirates. When compared with the likes of British Airways, Etihad and American Airlines, Emirates wins by a mile. Todays flight was excellent. The First class cabin was lovely, the onboard Spa was truly refreshing and spacious. I was well looked after by the head purser on this flight. The food and beverage offer were of high quality, and last but not least, the ICE entertainment was phenomenal - you are literally spoilt for choice. The chauffeur driven services in both destinations were excellent and extremely useful; a superb feature when travelling premium. The only downside is the Wifi connection is slightly slow and sluggish. It is complimentary however when travelling premium. I would recommend flying with Emirates again and cant wait to fly again with them.

899,"  Manchester to Cape Town via Dubai. We chose to experience Emirates based on their reputation, despite taking a longer route via DBX. Apart from the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screen, the flight was fine. Cabin temperature could have been slightly warmer for comfort. The second leg from Dubai to Cape Town on an older 777 was much less than perfect. On one of our seats the overhead light was not working and given this was a night flight needed. Whilst on the stand I reported this to a member of staff who told me that they could not move us to another seat as we were a couple. We had the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screens with random actions and scrolling cursors. The area we were seated in was extremely cold and my wife ended up using four of the airline blankets to try and be warm enough to get some sleep. I went for a walk around the economy area and found in all other areas the temperature was adequate. We appeared to be sat below an air con portal blowing cold air. This affected say ourselves and another dozen or so passengers who could be spotted by their huddled looks with coats and blankets. When I asked about this I was told that “Computer says” it’s 25 degrees. In our zone it was probably about 12 degrees. The member of staff was dismissive. It would have been bad enough if they had agreed but apologised that nothing could be fixed in-flight. I decided to seek the supervisor. In regards to the heating they did accept there was a fault and that staff should have not tried to ignore the issue. On the matter of the overhead light they said that we could have been reseated in row 50 as there was space at take off. They agreed with comments about the issues and the poor customer service. They said they would take immediate verbal action with staff in flight and would file a report regarding my issues at base. They presented me with a business card without names on and an email address to write to. On arrival in Cape Town I sent a comprehensive report to the alleged customer service email on the business card. I received a curt rejection pointing me to the on-line complaints form. Emirates customer complaints response indicates that their target is to respond in 30 days. Having heard nothing before we were heard nothing before we were due to fly back home. On my return via Johannesburg, I asked to speak to the Emirates group side manager, to see if anything had been planned in response to our complaint. After a long period of time the manager informed me that it was with the UK Customer Relations unit and still under investigation. To date still no contact some 37 days later. On the return trip home my wife encountered a problem with a member of staff pointing her finger to get out of the way effectively, without saying a word. Another poor PR exercise was a steward reading a tablet and in the hearing of others selecting a passenger individually and indicating they were a frequent customer and if there is anything I can do for you my name is...  My general feeling is that Emirates is resting on its historic reputation. Having flown Qatar Airways they are still maintaining customer services a better standard.

907," Flew Amsterdam to Dubai. Emirates has some of the laziest cabin crew in the industry. The quality of their service has been tanking for years now and whereas small details used to set a new standard, most of these details are no longer offered. I have flown Emirates many times and somehow they never manage to leave on time - and rarely do they make up for lost time. This flight for example landed 40 minutes past schedule. When you leave later and spend more time on board, details start to matter. Like for example how long it takes before meals are served. But even as important as when the meal trays are collected. The first they try to stall for obvious reasons, they used to serve 2 meals on these flights and now 1 and some crackers. The later they serve it, the less obvious the difference. The second causes unnecessary annoyance. When you’re in a window seat and have to wait for 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to clear the trays - and you have to use the toilet - you’re going to start having doubts about their service. Their crew are more occupied getting to know each other and sharing party stories than being involved in the service they should offer. In the absence of alternatives like Qatar Airways, you’re almost forced to fly Emirates to most of the Middle East, which is another annoyance. I am starting to give up hope the Emirates of the 2008-2013 era will ever return. They have become a very ordinary airline with nothing special to offer except a large screen (which I don’t even use because I prefer to sleep)."," Flew Amsterdam to Dubai.

After cleared the security, I bought some duty free stuffs from Chicago ORD airport and there is no question in Chicago airport boarding.After I reached Dubai when I board Chennai Airport Emirates staff asked me to weight cabin bag and duty free stuff and they said everything has to be placed in the cabin bag. They kicked out me out of the queue and asked me to arrange my luggage. I spent 10-15 minutes to arrange everything. After arranging every stuffs they said my cabin is overweight (includes duty free stuff). They suggested to reduce weight by throwing some stuff in trash or return duty free stuffs. Since the duty free stuffs I bought from US I couldn't able to return and they said I need to pay fee then only they can let me in. Staff behavior is totally not unacceptable, Emirates staffs are trying to steal money from customers my saying you have addition weight on your luggage. Staffs didn't say anything about the price detail and they charged me USD120 which more than the dutyfree stuff/10lb extra weight. Finally I saw my card was Charged $120 for $80 dollar stuff. This is my worst travel experience ever. If you have a policy then why are you allowing the duty free in ORD airport and not Dubai. If the duty free stopped in ORD airport I would have returned in ORD airport. Since the duty free stuffs are allowed in ORD I couldn't able to return in Dubai and I am force to pay. I am returning back to US today and restricted my baggage today to avoid any confusion but there is no cabin baggage verification or weight check happened today. Few of the economy passengers have both Cabin luggage and back pack and some of them have cabin luggage, back pack and Duty free from Dubai but no one was checking.

This wheelchair was once again confirmed prior to her flight. And again after her flight experience. Each time an Emirates representative told me that her wheelchair is booked all along each stop. However on 23rd February 2018, upon arrival in Dubai, she wasn’t given a wheelchair, instead ground staff rudely told her she had to walk as they couldn’t accommodate her a wheelchair.  Did not expect this from Emirates. As a result my mother was helped by 3 other passengers who helped her reach her connecting flight.  At this point I’m besides myself and have no words to express my fury over Emirates and its customer service. On her return flight on March 6, we had made multiple calls and emails requesting the highest level of wheelchair (apparently Emirates has levels of wheelchairs). Yes once again, she was denied a wheelchair at Dubai airport. Instead, Ground staff made her walk.

I was not asked to pay extra on any of the other flights on this booking. Only on this flight going to Chennai. I pointed out that I was coming from Chicago, had no check-in luggage, and the check-in desk in Chicago had no problem with my luggage. I also pointed out that I travel business class all the time on many different airlines and this is the first time that I was being asked to pay extra at the gate. They would not listen and forced me to pay an extra $80 on top of the business class fare before I could board the flight. This was unfair given that they were not enforcing their rules strictly for other business class passengers.  I am now very reluctant to fly Emirates again.

925,"  Hong Kong to Dubai. I was sitting in 42C (originally sitting on 42B but changed seats by someone else) on the aisle. The flight was really full that it was trying to get all travelers from Hong Kong and nearby cities to Dubai. The boarding gate was fair that I need to take the train to my boarding gate.  Cabin crew were nice and ready to help us. The meal selection included either Chicken or Beef, which I chose the Chicken with pasta which I think the taste is fair, not really good at all. I had ordered their cup noodles as well but it was neither taste well . The ICE flight entertainment is really good, however the hardware was not so adapted into it. The plane was quite old and they use the setup which years ago does. I could understand with that but I think it's time to get some renovation on that plane, which they could change to the setup on their Boeing 777-300ER. After some time of sleep, the snack came with Beef sandwich with drinks. Even though the sandwich was dry, it tastes better than the dinner. Before the flight landed, some travelers attempted to change seat even though the belt sign was on for a while, the cabin crew had to yell to stop them but those travelers changed anyway. The flight arrive Dubai almost an hour earlier than expected. Hope next time I will have better experience on this flight.","  Hong Kong to Dubai.

927,"  Travelled from Birmingham to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai, with a 24 hrs stop in Dubai on return. Chauffeur came on time as arranged. Lovely chap. Got to BHX. Dropped off directly outside check in. First time at this airport and not impressed. Lounge is small with a selection of warm food. Struggled to get reception to use mobile. Seat 20A although business class felt claustrophobic. Food was nicely presented. Wasn’t too keen on starter (the chicken mango confit) main Opted for duck which was lovely. No amenity bag given on day flight. Which is a shocker. Flight was full as such the bar area was packed. Arrived at DXB connecting flight in concourse B. Business lounge seem like a free for all where they allowed anyone in. Over crowded and not enough seating. Showers busy, dark and outdated. Flight to KL seats better. Night flight food was breakfast. Had the omelette which wasn’t overly nice. Arrived on time. Had to get train to the baggage hall. 1st one to arrive. My flight companion bag came off 1st. However due to error by BHX not labelling my bag correctly with business tag it came off around an hour later with the economy passengers. As such missed my connection. Anyway return journey in business lounge in KL very small. Showers were a bit worn out and not clean. Food was barely warm and limited. Night flight and managed to get a few hours sleep. Breakfast served was same as on way in therefore wasn’t too keen. Just had hot chocolate and cake. Arrived 4:30am. Had 24 hrs in Dubai. Freshened up in lounge then went into Dubai city. Final leg was departing from concourse A which was world apart from B. It was much cleaner. Less crowded and overall better. Showers nice and clean. Was offered slippers too. Food was more fresh. There was a nice white area with a lounge chair where I managed to get a few hours sleep before the flight. Boarded return to Manchester. Again night flight. Breakfast options so slept all way. Best sleep so far on the 4 sector of the journey. Maybe because I was tired. Service good, food fair Business lounge-concourse B poor, concourse A good.

931," We've had a pretty good experience. The lounge in Amsterdam Emirates shares with other airlines is nothing to write home about. The A380 is a marvellous machine, though the seat arrangement is not couple friendly if you want to sit next to a window. You can only sit together in the middle rows. The service and the food were as expected. The sky bar is a fantastic gimmick except if you want to sleep with your seat close to the bar. Choose a seat away from the bar if you want quiet. Our connecting flight departed from Terminal C which we did not particularly like. Lots of construction going on. The Emirates Lounge offers less amenities than the one in Terminal B. However, the food selection was excellent. The Dubai to Mumbai leg was a bit of a letdown. The plane looked rather old. The age of the airliner was particularly evident in the entertainment system. The screen resolution was that of the past decade, so underwhelming. The remote control still had a phone on one side which says it all. The service and the breakfast served were good however. After this experience we were worried that for the return leg to Dubai again and old 777-300ER would be used. Additionally, web check-in did not work and our hotel only reached their Mumbai office after trying all day. We did not know whether we would be seated together until we arrived at Mumbai airport. To our pleasent surprise we were seated together and the plane was much newer with excellent screens, the separate iPad and the remote control that looks like a Playstation portable. The range of Entertainment programs Emirates' ICE system offers is fabulous. We used the lounge in Terminal B which is superior to the one in Terminal C. An absolute highlight is the Moet and Chandon bar. Very friendly staff. The last leg from Dubai to Amsterdam was again an excellent experience with good food and friendly service. The limousine transfer worked well. However, the communcation skills of the limousine service center in Mumbai could be improved. Communcation was done with abbreviated text messages and rather informal, the way teenagers communicate."," We've had a pretty good experience.

933,  I flew overnight Birmingham to Dubai then 1hour 30min stopver before flight to Melbourne. Upon arriving in Dubai I checked the board and saw Emirates flight to Melbourne leaving from gate x so I headed to gate x. Then I checked another board and it said gate z for Emirates flight to Melbourne. I figured that gate had changed and headed to gate z. When boarding was happening for Emirates flight to Melbourne at gate z they informed me I had missed my flight which left from gate x. They were very rude and said I had to go to the Emirates connections counter. They informed me that there were 2 Emirates flights to Melbourne  leaving an hour apart and I had gone to the wrong gate. I also discovered that Dubai airport had a new policy (6 months) of no flight boarding announcements or for late passengers so they can have a nice quiet airport where passengers miss their flights. I said to the Emirates staff that they had a duty of care to inform me at check in that there was 2 flights leaving to Melbourne so I wouldn't miss my flight. Another Emirates staff admitted to me that passengers miss this flight to Melbourne every day because of this 2 flight situation. Emirates would not change my ticket as well as Qantas who sold the original ticket (Airline partnership situation) so I had to buy a new ticket for that leg £440. So in summary Emirates knew passengers miss this flight everyday because of the unusual situation of 2 Emirates Melbourne flights leaving Dubai each day within 1 hour yet they choose not the inform their passengers at check in of this situation so they can daily double charge their passengers.

My experience of the flight was ok, but my experience with the transport of baggage and the customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I go on a surf trip 3-4 times a year and I always pack my board the same way with allot of bubble wrapper, towels, pillows and a good board bag and I have never had any problems. On the trip down when I unpacked my board I had a few cracks that I had to fix. I called Emirates, and a very rude customer service member said that someone would call me up, of course no one did. But lesson learned. On my way back I packed my board even more carefully and added a fragile sign on the bag. To my chock when I packed up my board on arrival in Amsterdam, it was completely destroyed and rendered it useless. I called Emirates who refuse to take this matter on the telephone but told me they wont cover anything but I could send them a mail. Which I did. In the email I pointed to according to the Montreal convention they are responsible for any damage they cause on the baggage. The response was very simple. ""we are sorry for the broken board but we can and wont do anything about it, and we will not answer any more enquiries regarding this matter"" I have emailed them many times after that but the refuse to answer. My friend travelling to Copenhagen also got his board destroyed and same horrible treatment by Emirates. That’s why I write this review, I want to warn everybody to travel with Emirates! As long as you pay and shut up there is no problem but when they have caused a problem they wont do anything about it.

935," Flew Fort Lauderdale to Casablanca via Dubai. For the longest time, I had wanted to fly Emirates, I was curious by its ads claiming to be the best economy airline in the world. In fact, about 2 years ago, I had the chance to travel to Dubai and visit Emirates training centre, where we toured the facilities, it all looked very impressive and glamorously chic. I could not wait to experience all the glamour they so advertised. I get to the counter to check in and I was expecting luxury, beautiful people in Emirates fashion, just like advertised, reality was far off as clerks at counter were just plain Janes, no problem at all, just felt cheated. Finally, boarding time came, and I was so anxious to get on board. As I get thru the plane’s door, I suddenly realize, is this a joke? Did I step into the wrong plane? Where is all the bedazzle, all the luxury, all the hype Emirates told me I should expect? As I walk thru first class, business class and finally economy, I am hit with the realization of stepping into an old aircraft, that is outdated and challenged in sophistication, style and leg room. Delta, United or American Airlines would have offered the same experience, so what makes Emirates the best economy airline in the world? This was scheduled to be a 14 + hour flight from Fort Lauderdale to Dubai, can’t Emirates use the most comfortable, newest aircrafts for these long-haul flights instead of using aircrafts that should only be used for local or short flights? Emirates certainly does not think so. Employee’s presentation, another let down, no gorgeous counter or on-board flight attendants which left a lot to be desired, not all smiles here, far from the gorgeous look I was expecting. Cabin service was a let down as well, for a 14-hour flight, I would have expected more than just dinner (when dinner was served, I had the Szechuan chicken, it was tasteless). Breakfast, a wine selection and at least a couple of snack offerings throughout the 14-hour flight, we had to get up and ask for water several times. Overall my first experience flying with Emirates was nothing as expected, it was just as underwhelming as flying with any other average airline in the market. I will say that Emirates has a brilliant marketing strategy, unfortunately, it took one time flying with them to debunk all the hype and to make me want to fly Delta or American internationally, again.  "," Flew Fort Lauderdale to Casablanca via Dubai. For the longest time, I had wanted to fly Emirates, I was curious by its ads claiming to be the best economy airline in the world. In fact, about 2 years ago, I had the chance to travel to Dubai and visit Emirates training centre, where we toured the facilities, it all looked very impressive and glamorously chic. I could not wait to experience all the glamour they so advertised. I get to the counter to check in and I was expecting luxury, beautiful people in Emirates fashion, just like advertised, reality was far off as clerks at counter were just plain Janes, no problem at all, just felt cheated. Finally, boarding time came, and I was so anxious to get on board. As I get thru the plane’s door, I suddenly realize, is this a joke? Did I step into the wrong plane? Where is all the bedazzle, all the luxury, all the hype Emirates told me I should expect? As I walk thru first class, business class and finally economy, I am hit with the realization of stepping into an old aircraft, that is outdated and challenged in sophistication, style and leg room.

936,"  Cairo to Bangkok via Dubai. Don't get fooled once you see an attractive ticket price, as those attractive prices have a dark side in the T&C, especially when you are dealing with a big airline like emirates, so they never solve the problem once it happens, and you start getting bullied by their complaint department. You will be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads, and they have those monsters in their back office! what even make it worst, is that I am a regular customer since 2008 & I am on their skyward mileage reward, with a very good/strong history but still wasn't enough, and they unleashed those complaint team on me. I bought a ticket with a stopover in Dubai, and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more, so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesn't allow me to stay 1 more day (Max 7 days), and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket! So I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me! So I submitted a complaint, and  asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn't make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there's no way out and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back.  Anyway, I only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me, and if you have the time to read the T&C then please do - otherwise you will get bullied by their complaint department.","  Cairo to Bangkok via Dubai.

939," My daughter has travelled with Emirates a couple of times and had excellent experiences and hence recommended me to take Emirates to fly back to India from the US. I was travelling alone and my daughter had booked wheelchair assistance for my entire itinerary. I suffer from varicose veins and also had recently injured my knee, both added up causing unbearable pain. I was offered wheelchair assistance at DTW (Michigan) airport where I boarded the flight and my daughter went home relieved that I would be provided wheelchair assistance for the rest of my itinerary. However, I was left in the lurch when I arrived in Boston airport to board flight to Bangalore via Dubai. I had very little time left to board the flight and had to push myself to walk fast with the unbearable pain. This continued in Dubai airport as once again there was no wheelchair assistance provided in Dubai. I somehow managed this time as I had two hours twenty minutes to board the next flight. This left me wondering why I was promised wheelchair assistance if the airline was not able to provide the promised service. I was totally disappointed as to how a passenger could be left unattended to by a reputed airline in spite of the request for wheelchair assistance/help."," My daughter has travelled with Emirates a couple of times and had excellent experiences and hence recommended me to take Emirates to fly back to India from the US.

942," Emirates service has really gone down in the last few years. Probably, it has resulted from the cost-cutting measures they had to take. It's competition Qatar Airways has, on the other hand, improved quite a lot and even Etihad has better service on some parameters. On my last trip I observed the following: 1) The flight was delayed from 4.10 to 4.40 from India according to the announcement but the flight actually started boarding at 5. Because of this most of us were running for our connecting flights in Dubai. 2) At least 10 passengers when reaching Zurich couldn't find their luggage and we hope to get it tomorrow. 3) They recently introduced a 20kg limit on international flights for the economy class. What a good way to surprise customers and make more money. 4) I cannot explain how rude the staff were. 5) The toilets were not clean and the body lotion was not refilled. 6) Headphones were not working and they had to change it twice for me. Oman Air has disposable earbuds, they should learn from that. 7) Food was awful. They should learn from Etihad or Qatar.

943," Flew Birmingham to Sydney via Dubai. I fly this route frequently and this has been the worst case of passenger handling I have come across. Emirates has 2 gates (42 and 44) and 4 air bridges to load the plane, yet the affair was poorly managed and far beneath a quality airline. The attendant at the boarding gate lounge screened every boarding pass and sent various zones away to ‘take a seat’ (when there aren’t any seats near the gates). Perhaps use of a sign or 2 would be wise. Perhaps Emirates you can find a way to load a plane through 2 lounges without treating the passengers as inconvenient cattle. The staff gave poor instructions and were cranky with the crowd. Comments like ‘you’ll all get on’ shouldn’t be needed. At one point we were all told to line up against the glass outside the lounge like school kids. Enough to go back to Qatar or Etihad on my next flight."," Flew Birmingham to Sydney via Dubai.

946,"  Glasgow to Auckland via Dubai. Emirates fell very short of their much hyped quality service on the flight from Dubai to Auckland on 26 Dec 2017. I had the misfortune to fly with them from Dubai to Auckland. The ground staff were very rude and unhelpful in Dubai, it took an age to get our boarding passes checked and when I did eventually get to my allotted seat I found someone else sitting there with exactly the same boarding pass!! the airplane was pushing back for take off while I was still standing in the galley while the air crew were trying to find me a seat! what does that say about their Health and safety and security. Anyhow the killer was that after the 17 hour flight to Auckland we had to queue an extra 3 hours in the airport to record the fact that our bags had not arrived. In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained  (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation. Emirates service once again has fallen well short of what could be reasonably expected from a quality airline. I fly to Australia at least once a year - I'll be looking at alternative airlines from now on. Very poor service.","  Glasgow to Auckland via Dubai.

The best is the Entertainment systems which seems to have no limitation, definitively one of the best. During the 24 hours airborne wit Emirates in First, no crew member ever addressed me ever by name, with the exception of the cabin crew directors when making their 'welcome round"" in First and read my name from the passengers list.","[('Zurich', 'n'), ('Auckland', 'n'), ('via', None), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('.', None), ('parts', 'n'), ('journey', 'n'), ('Zurich', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('Dubai', 'n'), ('Auckland', 'n'), ('A380', 'n'), (',', None), ('aircraft', 'n'), ('rather', 'r'), ('old', 'a'), ('versions', 'n'), ('.', None), ('flights', 'n'), ('smooth', 'n'), ('many', 'a'), ('turbulences', 'n'), ('.', None), ('food', 'n'), ('fine', 'a'), (',', None), ('definitively', 'r'), ('standard', 'n'), ('quality', 'n'), (',', None), ('presentation', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), ('like', None), ('one', 'n'), ('competitors', 'n'), ('Asia', 'n'), ('(', None), ('Cathay', 'n'), (')', None), ('Europe', 'n'), ('(', None), ('Swiss', 'n'), (')', None), ('.', None), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('excellent', 'a'), ('wines', 'n'), ('France', 'n'), ('Australasia', 'n'), ('flights', 'n'), (',', None), ('handling', 'n'), ('expensive', 'a'), ('wines', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('disappointing', 'a'), (':', None), ('mostly', 'r'), ('crew', 'n'), ('filled', 'v'), ('wineglasses', 'n'), ('completely', 'r'), ('one', None), ('occasion', 'n'), ('steward', 'n'), ('filled', 'v'), ('Great', 'n'), ('Bordeaux', 'n'), ('glas', 'n'), ('enjoyed', 'v'), ('Merlot', 'n'), ('.', None), ('crew', 'n'), ('diverse', 'a'), ('minimal', 'a'), ('standard', 'n'), ('service', 'n'), (',', None), ('overall', 'a'), ('plainly', 'r'), ('disappointing', 'a'), ('lot', 'n'), ('times', 'n'), ('unprofessional', 'a'), ('.', None), ('best', 'a'), ('Entertainment', 'n'), ('systems', 'n'), ('seems', 'v'), ('limitation', 'n'), (',', None), ('definitively', 'r'), ('one', None), ('best', 'a'), ('.', None), ('24', None), ('hours', 'n'), ('airborne', 'a'), ('wit', 'n'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('First', 'n'), (',', None), ('crew', 'n'), ('member', 'n'), ('ever', 'r'), ('addressed', 'v'), ('ever', 'r'), ('name', 'n'), (',', None), ('exception', 'n'), ('cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('directors', 'n'), ('making', 'v'), (""'welcome"", 'a'), ('round', 'n'), (""''"", None), ('First', 'n'), ('read', 'v'), ('name', 'n'), ('passengers', 'n'), ('list', 'n'), ('.', None)]","  Zurich Auckland via Dubai . part journey Zurich Dubai Dubai Auckland A380 , aircraft rather old version . flight smooth many turbulence . food fine , definitively standard quality , presentation service like one competitor Asia ( Cathay ) Europe ( Swiss ) .

952, Had a really good experience flying with Emirates from Bengaluru to Dammam via Dubai. Both flights were on time. The aircraft used on the BLR-DXB sector was a bit old. The entertainment was amazing but the touch screen was not responsive. The food was not that good to be frank and the cabin crew were very friendly. They gave toys for kids and had special food for them. Flight landed on time but we were parked away from the terminal and the bus took around 30 minutes to arrive at the aircraft. Since I had 5 hrs layover it was not a problem for me. The aircraft used on the DXB-DMM sector was a brand new aircraft and this aircraft was much better than the previous one. The screens were much larger and they were very responsive unlike the previous one but could not do much since it was only a 45 minute flight. The sandwich served was awful.

955,"  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Emirates has changed the configuration of its daily Bangkok/Hong Kong return flight from 3 class to a reduced business class and substantially increased economy class. This results in a total of 615 passengers. The problem is that it is the front half of the upper deck that has been given over to economy resulting in premium passengers having to wait till these have disembarked before they can get off. Since lower deck passengers are also disembarking earlier, a quick exit to Immigration is now out of the question! Almost all other A380 operators more sensibly put the extra economy seats at the back of the upper deck. That said, Emirates service remains excellent. The Bangkok lounge offers a wide range of food and drink. On board hot towels are lightly scented and lunch menus have a choice of 3 entrees and superb wines. The bar offers premium liquors and many different canapés for those not wishing the full meal. I just have two slightly negative comments about the on-board service. With the reduced business class it would be nice if an after take-off drink is offered. Frequently one has to wait for up to 45 minutes for the meal service to start before any drinks are brought round. Secondly, despite the huge variety of entertainment offered, I still find the revised entertainment programme guide a total design mess. It is impossible to find out if movies are comedies/dramas/action etc. Worse, the guide provides no timings, so you have no idea if you have enough time to watch a full movie. The only way to check length is by wasting time loading each individual movie. For the price, though, EK remains an excellent choice on this route.","  Bangkok to Hong Kong.

957,"  Delhi to New York via Dubai. I departed New Delhi and on reaching Dubai, I had a 2 hour layover. I had a sore throat and a cough while traveling so I went straight to the gate to request for a window seat and explained my condition to them but they denied my request. Over time, my health deteriorated a little more. When I went up to the gate staff to talk to them again, they called the medics to get me checked. The medics said I was okay to travel but at this point, the gate supervisor demanded for a doctor's note to ensure I was okay to fly. I don't understand why they needed a doctor's note when we the medics said okay. Anyway, I tried to convince the supervisor because it was incredibly important for me to get back to New York on Tuesday morning as I had some important meetings lined up. They refused. I was taken to the doctor which was one building away, and given some medicine. The doctor gave me a note in no time and I was sent back to the gate without any assistance. They took me to the hospital on the airport hospital shuttle but I was made to walk back in that condition. It took me 20 minutes to walk back to the gate to find the supervisor, who had told me I would be moved to the next flight instead once I have the doctor's note. There was no one at the gate and I was directed to the ticketing counter. After waiting the long line, they asked me to pay for my new flight, which I refused to do. First off, being a college student, I did not the money to pay for another ticket. Secondly, it wasn't my decision to not board the previous flight. The gate staff decided on my behalf and I shouldn't be made to pay for a decision they made. I tried to explain my situation to the person at ticketing but they were no help and asked me to wait another hour to see the manager, because there was a shift change apparently and they said I couldn't be helped. I finally got to see the manager and she directed me to the PRO office and said it wasn't in her hands. I walked to the PRO office and begged for help because at that point, I felt vulnerable. I was exhausted and hadn't sleep in over 24 hours. They kept stalling me and sending me to different authorities.  I waited until 7 and then finally the PROs called me in only to tell me I had to pay 740 AED for a flight change and that's all they can do. I felt emotionally drained so I did whatever they said to just get back home.  As a consequence, I missed my flight from JFK to ROC which I had to rebook at an extra cost.

Great spacious seat and fantastic entertainment systems. The food onboard the flight was great with a great selection of onboard beverages and well-presented meals. I was very disappointed by the crew and received dull and uninterested service. The staff seemed to have no interest in the guests traveling. The service was efficient but cold.

Flight 229, Dubai to Seattle. I last flew Emirates business class two years ago and it was good. Since then, quality has severely declined. The aircraft for this flight was - according to the attendant - 15 days old. They attendants didn’t know how to use the seats. The seats themselves we not much wider than economy class. Though they were lie-flat seats, the seats were “cupped” so you sunk into the middle when you lie them flat. Uncomfortable! This could have been softened by an attentive and helpful staff member however even getting water was difficult. The flight attendants didn’t offer anything between breakfast and lunch nor between lunch and dinner. For business class, this is completely unacceptable. I had to ask several times just for water. When I said thank you, they did not even say 'you’re welcome'. Really awful.","

963,"  Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai. We were scheduled to fly out of Manchester airport on Wednesday 20th December at 20.35. On check in we noticed that the flight time had been changed to around 21.10. We were not notified of any changes and the Emirates staff who checked us in gave us no explanation as to why this had been moved. After being in the airport a couple of hours we then noticed our flight had been further delayed. We were meant to arrive into Dubai international at 07.45 for our flight to Bangkok at 09.35, so the fact that the flight was delayed made us worry as we did not know whether we would make our connection flight. As a result we contacted our travel agent at Flight centre about our concern whilst in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. They called Emirates to raise the alarm that if there was a delay we would struggle to make a connection flight. We eventually boarded our flight and left Manchester almost two hours late and arrived in Dubai at 09.12. On the aircraft the captain told us that we were delayed due to the Emirates plane leaving Dubai late. We missed our flight, we had no apologies and the only option to get us to Bangkok in time for the 07.30 flight was to fly at 16.00 to Mumbai with Emirates and then a flight to Bangkok with Thai airways. This would land us at around 05.00 and in the meantime we would have a hotel room and lunch. We had to take this option but were not happy as this would mean we would lose our money on the hotel in Bangkok and our dinner reservation. However, the flight to Mumbai landed late, which caused us more anxiety then the flight to Bangkok took off late so we landed with under two hours till our next flight. I am extremely disappointed with the service I received with Emirates. The unexplained delays, unhelpful and rude staff in some cases, as well as missing our night in Bangkok was just not good enough. We were travelling for over 36 hours to Bangkok when we should have been there over 12 hours earlier. Whilst we appreciate that Emirates put us onto alternative flights to get to Bangkok we should have already been on the 11:45 flight as soon as our travel agent had contacted whilst we were still in Manchester. It was not the perfect start to our honeymoon, we spent time hanging around airports or on planes.","  Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai.

964,"  Newark to Dhaka via Athens and Dubai and back to Newark via same routes. Dreamed about these long haul flights, but got very disappointed - what has happened to Emirates? No longer the comfortable journeys I had enjoyed previously. Service extremely poor and chaotic. No air hostess seemed to care in spite of pointing out several times. Disappointed to find no pre-dinner drinks or appetizers, but only a good-looking menu with a list of fancy items - not so delicious to eat, unfortunately. They missed serving me dinner while most of my fellow passengers were enjoying theirs. Had to call an exhausted air hostess twice, but all in vain. Got my dinner after 30 min when all my co-passengers finished eating. Drinks were very sparse, not offered more than once, coffees were cold and tasteless, and most foods were poor and stale - mostly carbohydrate-heavy with almost no green salads. Not the best airline for service I have flown with for some time across the oceans. On my return flights an online offer popped up during the online check-in to upgrade to business class, but I got to upgrade for the first leg of the journey only - not the entire route as the offer disappeared on my second try (it gave me only one chance to upgrade). Not impressed with the business class kit-bag or other amenities. Couldn't sleep in the modernized recliner at all. Free business class lounge uses at Dubai airport were not offered in spite of buying an upgrade. I am sorry for Emirates that used to be one of the rare 5 star airlines. From Dubai to Athens to Newark, the rest of the journey was more like you would expect from a budget airline. Really disappointed, won't recommend to any friend or family, and will try to avoid in the future, unless a genuine offer is made.","  Newark to Dhaka via Athens and Dubai and back to Newark via same routes.

971,"  Brisbane to Birmingham via Dubai. We flew on an overnight A380 Emirates flight from Brisbane to Dubai in late September, leaving Brisbane late at night. Flying time was 14 hours 20 minutes non-stop. This was sleeping time - I thought. I paid the extra $55 to select seats in economy for my wife and myself. I boarded and sat down to our long haul flight on a seat that was already broken. The recline wouldn’t lock in, and made an awful clunking noise whenever I moved the seat back or forward. After a few hours I had worked out that if I pushed back hard and held on with my feet and my back I could get the seat to recline. But as soon as I let the pressure off it immediately sprung back – in fact it sprung back past normal upright. You can imagine the result - 14 hours plus of long haul discomfort, battling with this seat! Naturally I couldn’t keep it up for the whole flight, and so after a few hours I sat upright – or past upright. Given that the seat in front was fully reclined, while mine was leaning forward, I couldn’t even put my head on the tray table. I mentioned the problem to the Emirates staff on board, but nothing could be done as it was a full flight, they said. So I left it at that. On our return home to Brisbane a month later I wrote to Emirates about the matter. They said that they would respond within 30 days, after they had gathered the facts. On day 30 I had no answer, so I prompted them for a reply. Yes, they eventually said in their response – the seat you selected was in fact broken on that flight - we knew about it as we had a logged report on it. Sorry to hear that you didn’t find the flight comfortable. (They obviously knew about the problem on the day that they received my email - but they deliberately held out responding for the full 30 days – hoping, no doubt, that I’d forget the matter.) They went on to say:- “Given that you had availed of the Advance Seat Reservation and paid AUD55.00 for the seat, we will be pleased to refund this charge to you. Kindly provide your bank details in order to process a bank transfer to your account….thank you for taking the time and trouble to write to us. ” That was it. If I had not paid $55 to select the seat – would Emirates have just written back (after 30 days) to say, sorry about your long uncomfortable flight in our broken seat, but too bad – nothing more we will do? If you are an economy class traveller like me, find an airline where passengers like you and me have had some genuine, and timely, resolution to their genuine issues. Don’t fly Emirates economy!

All in all the staff was probably the rudest it can be, we hardly met any kindness or smiles, although they cooled down the aircraft to something between 15 and 10 C degrees they arrogantly collected all the blankets way before landing so we almost frozen to death.

Again I was told they were overbooked. When I asked I asked again in Dubai I was told, “yes, there are a few” just ask the cabin crew, which I did. I was told $1500 per person. This was three times the upgrade price I had been offered online! I mentioned this to the cabin crew who said they couldn’t help and that I should complain to customer service.

981," Jakarta to London via Dubai. This is the first time I took Emirates, and definitely my last. Boarding began from Jakarta and the ground staff was courteous. In-flight, I don't really expect much because the cabin crew is generally not willing to go out of their way to get you your cup of coffee, especially on a busy morning flight. The cabin looks and feel tight, though I am neither tall nor fat. The seats? It isn't worth commenting. Landing in Dubai for the transit to London, expect the usual UAE approach. Their ground service is next to zero. The Emirates lounge is big but not fantastic, it's overcrowded if anything. Boarding my flight to London was ok, but once onboard, again, do not expect good service. Some cabin crew try to smile, that's about as good as you can get. Once the plane is cruising, they go on their ""switch-off"" mode (chit-chat, etc) more than they are willing to serve. Wifi and sleeping are about the only things that can keep you sane inside this flight. Needless to say, upon arrival to London and once I'm comfortably checked into my hotel room, I dumped the return leg for an SQ one. Emirates, my foot."," Jakarta to London via Dubai.

985," London to Islamabad via Dubai. This was probably my worst experience ever with any airline I have ever traveled with. On my flight from London to Dubai, I was asked to move my stuff from my hand-carry to my check-in baggage and was charged a lot for the extra weight in my checked-in bag. Later, I had a layover at Dubai airport before my final destination. Just before boarding, the person at the gate charged me more than 150$ for my hand-carry again, when I told him specifically that I was charged at the London airport to move the weight to my checked in bag. The staff was extremely rude and apparently were even charging people who bought stuff from the duty-free shop. It seemed like Emirates was in desperate need of some extra cash. Since the flight was about to depart, nobody could really do much. There was a lot of anger and frustration. I was charged twice for almost the amount of a new ticket, and it did not make any sense. I am still unable to understand why and how the hand-carry at London airport that met the weight need (especially after moving the stuff to the checked in bag and paying for it) was charged again at the Dubai airport? In short, this really was my last time to choose Emirates to fly with. I am extremely disappointed in an airline that used to be one of my favorites. I will never use their services again."," London to Islamabad via Dubai. This was probably my worst experience ever with any airline I have ever traveled with.

996,"  London to Chennai via Dubai. Extremely disappointed with customer service at Dubai international airport.  I was stopped near the gates by a rude manager at Dubai during my transit flight. I was told that I was over my allowed cabin luggage allowance of 7kg. My cabin baggage weighed 10 kg, I tried to explain that the excess weight in my cabin luggage was from duty free goods. He asked me pay excess luggage or leave goods there. I had to leave things at the gates before I was allowed to board.

In their own words “ I must point out that Emirates hand baggage allowance for Economy class passengers has always been one piece not exceeding 7kgs.

998," My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38 hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates. Starting Sunday 10th December in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived Tuesday morining at 5 am in Hyderabad/India. For those who don´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14 hours. It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in Frankfurt. Well things like this happen, but sitting for more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, Emirates weren't able to serve even a glass of water to passengers. The flight itself to Dubai was ok. In order to get the connecting flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running through the airport and finally reached the gate right on time. Everything went fine, we even managed to be at the gate more than 30 min before gate-closing - that was my thought. Here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us that our seats had been already given away without any further explanation. This is something I can't understand, I also know from another colleague sitting on the plane that the flight even had free seats (in business as well as in economy). The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 am in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, there was a long lane of passengers at the counter. We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a line, standing on our feet without seeing any Emirates-employees offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we managed to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to Dubai (another 30min of waiting at immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another Emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 am in the morning, we got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 am in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep. Summary: On a long distance journey things can take a turn for the worse due to delays and this is quite normal. But: I can't understand why they acted like this. There was no apology and the inconvenience was tremendously high. This was my first experience with Emirates and at the moment I am not looking forward for the flight back to Germany."," My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38 hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates.

999," Flew Hong Kong to Bangkok. Despite getting negatives review Emirates is getting these days, my flights to and from Hong Kong went so smoothly. On both flights crew were lovely, smiling and efficient. This A380 had the first class removed and replaced with economy in the front of the upper deck. A bit odd but makes good sense, as the lounge bar is at the back, cutting economy class at the back will not make sense at all. 20K is a lovely window bulkhead seat, feels really private, everything is perfect working order. Welcome drinks and hot towels, crew were cheerful and happy to engage in a little chit chat. Wifi is free and unlimited, if you are a skyward member travelling in business and first class, regardless of the tire level. Connection is fairly good throughout most of the flights. Meals were delivered with everything on one tray, nice presentation and good taste. Champagne and all kind of alcoholic drinks are plentiful and free flowing should you require. Both flights were under 3 hours, sweet but short. With such competitive price comparing to other airlines, I have no hesitation to choose EK on this route, and also to the Middle East and Europe."," Flew Hong Kong to Bangkok.

Wifi is free and unlimited, if you are a skyward member travelling in business and first class, regardless of the tire level. Connection is fairly good throughout most of the flights. Meals were delivered with everything on one tray, nice presentation and good taste. Champagne and all kind of alcoholic drinks are plentiful and free flowing should you require. Both flights were under 3 hours, sweet but short. With such competitive price comparing to other airlines, I have no hesitation to choose EK on this route, and also to the Middle East and Europe.","[('Flew', 'n'), ('Hong', 'n'), ('Kong', 'n'), ('Bangkok', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Despite', None), ('getting', 'v'), ('negatives', 'n'), ('review', 'v'), ('Emirates', 'n'), ('getting', 'v'), ('days', 'n'), (',', None), ('flights', 'n'), ('Hong', 'n'), ('Kong', 'n'), ('went', 'v'), ('smoothly', 'r'), ('.', None), ('flights', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('lovely', 'r'), (',', None), ('smiling', 'v'), ('efficient', 'a'), ('.', None), ('A380', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('class', 'n'), ('removed', 'v'), ('replaced', 'v'), ('economy', 'n'), ('front', 'n'), ('upper', 'a'), ('deck', 'n'), ('.', None), ('bit', 'n'), ('odd', 'a'), ('makes', 'v'), ('good', 'a'), ('sense', 'n'), (',', None), ('lounge', 'n'), ('bar', 'n'), ('back', 'n'), (',', None), ('cutting', 'v'), ('economy', 'n'), ('class', 'n'), ('back', 'n'), ('make', 'v'), ('sense', 'n'), ('.', None), ('20K', None), ('lovely', 'r'), ('window', 'a'), ('bulkhead', 'a'), ('seat', 'n'), (',', None), ('feels', 'n'), ('really', 'r'), ('private', 'a'), (',', None), ('everything', 'n'), ('perfect', 'a'), ('working', 'v'), ('order', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Welcome', 'a'), ('drinks', 'n'), ('hot', 'a'), ('towels', 'n'), (',', None), ('crew', 'n'), ('cheerful', 'a'), ('happy', 'a'), ('engage', 'v'), ('little', 'a'), ('chit', 'n'), ('chat', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Wifi', 'n'), ('free', 'a'), ('unlimited', 'a'), (',', None), ('skyward', 'a'), ('member', 'n'), ('travelling', 'n'), ('business', 'n'), ('first', 'a'), ('class', 'n'), (',', None), ('regardless', 'r'), ('tire', 'n'), ('level', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Connection', 'n'), ('fairly', 'r'), ('good', 'a'), ('throughout', None), ('flights', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Meals', 'n'), ('delivered', 'v'), ('everything', 'n'), ('one', None), ('tray', 'n'), (',', None), ('nice', 'a'), ('presentation', 'n'), ('good', 'a'), ('taste', 'n'), ('.', None), ('Champagne', 'n'), ('kind', 'n'), ('alcoholic', 'a'), ('drinks', 'n'), ('plentiful', 'a'), ('free', 'a'), ('flowing', 'n'), ('require', 'v'), ('.', None), ('flights', 'n'), ('3', None), ('hours', 'n'), (',', None), ('sweet', 'a'), ('short', 'a'), ('.', None), ('competitive', 'a'), ('price', 'n'), ('comparing', 'v'), ('airlines', 'n'), (',', None), ('hesitation', 'n'), ('choose', 'v'), ('EK', 'n'), ('route', 'n'), (',', None), ('also', 'r'), ('Middle', 'n'), ('East', 'n'), ('Europe', 'n'), ('.', None)]","  Flew Hong Kong Bangkok .
